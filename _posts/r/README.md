# Contribute to Plotly's [R Documentation](https://plot.ly/r/)
## Initial Steps:
0. Clone the repo and then check out the source-design-merge branch:

  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:plotly/documentation.git
  $ git fetch origin
  $ git checkout source-design-merge
  ```
1. [Install jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). <b>IMPORTANT</b> - [Install the same version that Github Pages is using: 3.0.3](https://pages.github.com/versions/):

  ```
  $ gem install jekyll -v 3.2.1
  ```
2. Install some dependencies:

  ```
  $ sudo gem install jekyll-redirect-from
  $ sudo gem install jekyll-sitemap
  $ sudo gem install terminal-notifier
  $ sudo gem install jemoji
  $ sudo gem install redcarpet
  ```

## Create R Documentation:

##### In `documentation/_posts/r`
1. Write your tutorial in R Markdown (Rmd) file (**IMPORTANT:** do not edit the markdown (md) files by hand! All edits should happen in the .Rmd file! The *only* exception to this is the index file: `2015-07-30-r-index.md` which you should edit directly.)
  - Your .Rmd file should be named in the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd-chart-type.Rmd`
  - Please base your tutorial off of one of our exsisting tutorials (i.e. `documentation/_posts/r/2015-11-19-shapes.Rmd`)
      - Include the following header (*replacing `your-tutorial-chart` with the type of chart you're creating in the tutorial.) :
      ```
      ---
      title: Your-Tutorial-Chart in R | Examples | Plotly
      name: Your-Tutorial-Chart
      permalink: r/your-tutorial-chart/
      description: How to create your-tutorial-chart in R. Short description of your tutorial.
      layout: base
      thumbnail: thumbnail/your-tutorial-chart.jpg *see step 2 for further thumbnail instructions*
      language: r
      page_type: example_index
      has_thumbnail: true
      display_as: chart_type
      order: 9 *see below for order instructions*
      output:
        html_document:
          keep_md: true
      ---
      ```
      *`order` defines the order in which the tutorials appear on plot.ly/r. Please take a look at https://plot.ly/r/ and order your tutorial next to similar chart types.
      - Under the header, include the following r code snippet. That first line of R code ensures that all subsequent code chunks do not relay message(s) or output results. That's because, in most cases, we want to provide code that produces an "offline" plot, but since [Jekyll and htmlwidgets aren't compatible](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll/issues/8#issuecomment-104112826), we're forced to embed plots as iframes.

      ```
        ```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
            knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning=FALSE)
            Sys.setenv("plotly_username"="RPlotBot")
            Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key"="q0lz6r5efr")```
      ```
    - New to Plotly and Version Check sections:
      ```
        ### New to Plotly?

        Plotly's R library is free and open source!<br>
        [Get started](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/) by downloading the client and [reading the primer](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/).<br>
        You can set up Plotly to work in [online](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#hosting-graphs-in-your-online-plotly-account) or [offline](https://plot.ly/r/offline/) mode.<br>
        We also have a quick-reference [cheatsheet](https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf) (new!) to help you get started!

        ### Version Check

        Version 4 of Plotly's R package is now [available](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#installation)!<br>
        Check out [this post](http://moderndata.plot.ly/upgrading-to-plotly-4-0-and-above/) for more information on breaking changes and new features available in this version.
          ```{r, results = 'hide'}
          library(plotly)
          packageVersion('plotly')```
      ```

    - To include r code and plots in the tutorial format the code snippets and plots in the following format:

    ```
      ```{r, results = 'hide'}
      library(plotly)
      #Add your R Code Here i.e.:
      p <- plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~uempmed, name = "unemployment")
      p

      # Create a shareable link to your chart
      # Set up API credentials: https://plot.ly/r/getting-started
      chart_link = plotly_POST(p, filename="your-chart-type/your-filename")
      chart_link```
    ```

    ```
      ```{r, echo=FALSE}
      chart_link```
    ```


2. Convert the `.Rmd` file to a `.md` file.
  - Single `.Rmd` file: convert the `.Rmd` file that you changed to a `.md` file by running: `Rscript -e 'knitr::knit("YOUR_FILE.Rmd")'` in your terminal.

  -Convert all the `.Rmd` files in your current directory: `for (i in dir(pattern = "\\.Rmd")) knitr::knit(i)` Or, in the terminal (`documentation/_posts/r`) with: `Rscript -e 'for (i in dir(pattern = "\\\.Rmd")) knitr::knit(i)'`

3. Add Thumbnail Images
  - Thumbnail images should named `your-tutorial-chart.jpg` and be *EXACTLY* 160px X 160px
  - Thumbnail images should be clear and interesting. You do not need to capture the ENTIRE chart, but rather focus on the most interesting part of the chart.
  - Use images.plot.ly for adding new images.
