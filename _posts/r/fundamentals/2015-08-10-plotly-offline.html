<ul>
<li><!--Since November 17 2015, --> Plotly R figures appear interactively within RStudio's graphics viewer <em>without any calls to Plotly's server</em> by default. This means that all plots generated in RStudio are offline. You will have to make a <code>plotly_POST</code> call in order to upload your plot onto the Plotly Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When you're ready to share, you can publish your Plotly R figures to the <a href="https://plot.ly/feed">Plotly Cloud</a> or to your company's internal <a href="https://plot.ly/product/enterprise">Plotly On-Premise</a> server.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Plotly graphics in RStudio sit on top of the <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/">HTML widgets</a> framework and use the open source javascript graphing library <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js">plotly.js</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
To get started with Plotly offline in RStudio, <a href="/r/getting-started">download Plotly's free R client</a>.

  <h3> Getting the HTML for a Plotly Graph </h3>
  <p>You could treat the viewer in RStudio as an embedded web browser. Thus it's possible to view the source of that page. What you have to do is
  click the <code>export button</code> in the viewer, and choose <code>Save as Web Page</code>.
  You will then be prompted to save the web page. Then you will be able to view the source code when viewing the plot.</p>

  <br>
  <p>
  An alternative method in which to get the html for your plot is to call the following command:
  <br><code>htmlwidgets::saveWidget(as.widget(p), "graph.html")</code>, where p will be your plot figure.
  Note that you could name the html file to anything you choose.

  <h3> Working with Shiny </h3>
  <p>With Shiny and Plotly you can now make data visualization interactive. What Shiny allows you to do is affect the state of your plots
  via widgets provided by the <code>Shiny</code> package or even custom widgets you write in HTML yourself. What this means is that you can interact
  with both the styling of the plots, as well as the data that's being plotted. Thus you can do things like filter date on the fly and have
  your plot reflect these changes. To get started, visit: <a href="https://plot.ly/r/shiny-tutorial/">https://plot.ly/r/shiny-tutorial/</a>, and for a collection of examples,
