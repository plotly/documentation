# Privacy Settings in R

Since Version 2.0 (November 15, 2015), Plotly for R renders graphs locally.
You can publish these graphs to the web with the command `plotly_POST`.

By default, plotly graphs are public.
You can make them private by setting the `world_readable` argument to `FALSE`.


```r
library(plotly)

p <- plot_ly(x = c(0, 2, 4), y = c(0, 4, 2))

# render locally
p
```

```r
# public
plotly_POST(p, filename="r-docs/public-graph")
```

```r
# private
plotly_POST(p, world_readable = FALSE, filename="r-docs/private-graph")
```

Creating public graphs on Plotly is free. To create more than one private graph, [sign up for a Plotly subscription](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/).
