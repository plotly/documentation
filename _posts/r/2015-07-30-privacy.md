# Privacy Settings in R

Plotly graphs are created in your online plotly account. By default, plotly graphs are public.
You can make them private by setting the `world_readable` argument to `FALSE`.





```r
library(plotly)

# public
plot_ly(x = c(0, 2, 4), y = c(0, 4, 2), filename="r-docs/public-graph")
```

```r
# private
plot_ly(x = c(0, 2, 4), y = c(0, 4, 2), world_readable = FALSE, filename="r-docs/private-graph")
```

```r
# another option is to "build" the plot, then tack on these properties
p <- plot_ly(x = c(0, 2, 4), y = c(0, 4, 2))
p <- plotly_build(p)
p$filename <- "r-docs/private-graph"
p$world_readable <- FALSE
p
```

Creating public graphs on Plotly is free. To create more than one private graphs, [sign up for a Plotly subscription](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/).
