# Privacy Settings in R

Since Version 2.0 (November 15, 2015), Plotly for R renders graphs locally.
You can publish these graphs to the web with the command `plotly_POST`.

By default, plotly graphs are public.
You can make them private by setting the `sharing` argument to either `secret` or `private`.
`private` will make it so that only the creator of the plot(while logged in), is able to 
view the plot. While `secret` will allow anyone you choose to share the `secret url` with to
view your plots.

# Render your plots locally

```r
library(plotly)

p <- plot_ly(x = c(0, 2, 4), y = c(0, 4, 2))
p
```

# Generate a public plot

```r
plotly_POST(p, filename="r-docs/public-graph")
```

# Generate a private plot

```r
plotly_POST(p, sharing = 'private', filename="r-docs/private-graph")
```

Creating public graphs on Plotly is free. To create more than one private graph, [sign up for a Plotly subscription](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/).
