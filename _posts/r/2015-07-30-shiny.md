# Plotly Graphs in Shiny

As of version 2.0, plotly's R package utilizes the [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) framework. As a result, it's easy to embed plotly graphs in [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps.

### Basic example

The key idea is to pass a plotly object to `renderPlotly()` on the server and place it in the UI with `plotlyOutput()`. Note that `renderPlotly()` also accepts ggplot2 objects (or ggplot2 objects converted to plotly objects via `ggplotly()`).


```r
library(shiny)
library(plotly)

ui <- fluidPage(
  plotlyOutput("plot"),
  verbatimTextOutput("event")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$plot <- renderPlotly({
    plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~mpg, y = ~wt)
  })
  
  output$event <- renderPrint({
    d <- event_data("plotly_hover")
    if (is.null(d)) "Hover on a point!" else d
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```


## More examples

We have a number of [more examples](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/tree/master/inst/examples) that ship with the R package
