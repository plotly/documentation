# Plotly Graphs in Shiny

Since plotly adheres to the [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) framework, it's easy to embed plotly graphs in [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps. Not only does this make it easy for your plotly graphs to change dynamically according to input values, but (thanks to `event_data()`) it is also easy to access user events with plotly graphs! Here is a fairly basic example of accessing hover events server-side:

```r
library(shiny)
library(plotly)

ui <- fluidPage(
  plotlyOutput("plot"),
  verbatimTextOutput("event")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # renderPlotly() also understands ggplot2 objects!
  output$plot <- renderPlotly({
    plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~mpg, y = ~wt)
  })
  
  output$event <- renderPrint({
    d <- event_data("plotly_hover")
    if (is.null(d)) "Hover on a point!" else d
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
