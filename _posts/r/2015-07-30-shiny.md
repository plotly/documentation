### New to Plotly?

Plotly's R library is free and open source!<br>
[Get started](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/) by downloading the client and [reading the primer](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/).<br>
You can set up Plotly to work in [online](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#hosting-graphs-in-your-online-plotly-account) or [offline](https://plot.ly/r/offline/) mode.<br>
We also have a quick-reference [cheatsheet](https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf) (new!) to help you get started!

### Version Check

Version 4 of Plotly's R package is now [available](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#installation)!<br>
Check out [this post](http://moderndata.plot.ly/upgrading-to-plotly-4-0-and-above/) for more information on breaking changes and new features available in this version.

```r
library(plotly)
packageVersion('plotly')
```
### Plotly Graphs in Shiny

Since plotly adheres to the [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) framework, it's easy to embed plotly graphs in [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps. Not only does this make it easy for your plotly graphs to change dynamically according to input values, but (thanks to `event_data()`) it is also easy to access user events with plotly graphs! Here is a fairly basic example of accessing hover events server-side:

<iframe src="https://plotly.shinyapps.io/Movies" width="100%" height=700 scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" style="border: none"></iframe>


```r
library(shiny)
library(plotly)

ui <- fluidPage(
  plotlyOutput("plot"),
  verbatimTextOutput("event")
)

server <- function(input, output) {

  # renderPlotly() also understands ggplot2 objects!
  output$plot <- renderPlotly({
    plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~mpg, y = ~wt)
  })

  output$event <- renderPrint({
    d <- event_data("plotly_hover")
    if (is.null(d)) "Hover on a point!" else d
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
