# Using Plotly with rmarkdown/knitr

## Embedding plotly graphs in Rmd files



If you are using [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) with HTML output, printing a `plotly` object in a code chunk will result in an interactive HTML graph. When using rmarkdown with non-HTML output, printing a `plotly` object will result in a png screenshot of the graph.


```r
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~unemploy / pop)
p
```

<iframe src="https://plot.ly/~RPlotBot/1286.embed" width="800" height="600" id="igraph" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" frameBorder="0"> </iframe>

Sometimes, you may want to print a _list_ of plotly objects. If, for some reason, you don't want to use the [`subplot()` function](https://plot.ly/r/subplots/), you can print a list of htmlwidgets in a single code chunk using the `tagList()` function from the **htmltools** package:


```r
htmltools::tagList(list(p, p))
```

You can also host your figures on a plotly server via `plotly_POST()` which returns a figure object. When a figure object is printed in an rmarkdown/knitr document, it embeds the figure as an iframe, displaying the plot as it appears on your plotly account.


```r
f <- plotly_POST(p)
class(f)
f
```

You can control the height/width of that iframe through the `height`/`width` [knitr chunk options](http://yihui.name/knitr/options/), but the figure object also contains the relevant url so you complete control over embedding your figure. The post has more details on how to [embed plotly graphs with HTML iframes](http://help.plot.ly/embed-graphs-in-websites/), but could also use plotly's built-in image export by simply adding a `.png` (or similar) extension.


```r
htmltools::tags$img(src = paste0(f[["url"]], ".png"))
```
