## Embedding plotly graphs in knitr documents




Simply printing `plotly` objects in the R console will create a new plotly figure in your online plotly account and open your web-browser to view it.


```r
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(economics, x = date, y = uempmed, filename="r-docs/knitr-example")
```

If you are using knitr/R Markdown with HTML output, printing the `plotly` object will not only create the plot but embed it in the HTML as an iframe. This document itself is written with R Markdown, so printing `p` embeds the figure.



```r
p
```

<iframe height="600" id="igraph" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" src="https://plot.ly/~RPlotBot/1286.embed" width="800" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

You can set the width and the height of the plot with `width` and `height` code chunk parameters. For example:

`{r, height=800}`


```r
p
```

<iframe height="800" id="igraph" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" src="https://plot.ly/~RPlotBot/1286.embed" width="800" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

If you are using [Plotly Offline with R Studio](https://purchasing.plot.ly/plotly-offline-r), then printing the plotly object in knitr will also include the necessary `plotly.js` files to draw the graph: the graph is rendered locally inside the document.

To convert the knitr document to a standalone HTML file, use `knitr::knit` and `markdown::markdownToHTML`. For example:

```
knitr::knit('plotly-report.Rmd', 'plotly-report.md')
markdown::markdownToHTML('plotly-report.md', 'plotly-report.html')
```
