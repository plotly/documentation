### New to Plotly?

Plotly's R library is free and open source!<br>
[Get started](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/) by downloading the client and [reading the primer](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/).<br>
You can set up Plotly to work in [online](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#hosting-graphs-in-your-online-plotly-account) or [offline](https://plot.ly/r/offline/) mode.<br>
We also have a quick-reference [cheatsheet](https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf) (new!) to help you get started!

### Version Check

Version 4 of Plotly's R package is now [available](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#installation)!<br>

s <- s[order(s$Men), ]

p <- plot_ly(s, x = ~Women, y = ~School, name = "Women", type = 'scatter',
             mode = "markers", marker = list(color = "pink")) %>%
  add_trace(x = ~Men, y = ~School, name = "Men",type = 'scatter',
            mode = "markers", marker = list(color = "blue")) %>%
  layout(

    xaxis = list(title = "Annual Salary (in thousands)"),
    margin = list(l = 100)
