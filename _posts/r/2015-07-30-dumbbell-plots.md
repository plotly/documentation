# Dumbbell plots in R | Examples | Plotly


### New to Plotly?

Plotly's R library is free and open source!<br>
[Get started](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/) by downloading the client and [reading the primer](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/).<br>
You can set up Plotly to work in [online](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#hosting-graphs-in-your-online-plotly-account) or [offline](https://plot.ly/r/offline/) mode.<br>
We also have a quick-reference [cheatsheet](https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf) (new!) to help you get started!

### Version Check

Version 4 of Plotly's R package is now [available](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#installation)!<br>

# Dot and Dumbbell Plots


```r
s <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/school_earnings.csv")
# order factor levels by men's income (plot_ly() will pick up on this ordering)
s$School <- factor(s$School, levels = s$School[order(s$Men)])

library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(s, color = I("gray80")) %>%
  add_segments(x = ~Women, xend = ~Men, y = ~School, yend = ~School, showlegend = FALSE) %>%
  add_markers(x = ~Women, y = ~School, name = "Women", color = I("pink")) %>%
  add_markers(x = ~Men, y = ~School, name = "Men", color = I("blue")) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Gender earnings disparity",
    xaxis = list(title = "Annual Salary (in thousands)"),
    margin = list(l = 65)
  )
p
