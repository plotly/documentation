<h4>Specifying filenames, overwriting files, and updating graphs at their unique URLs</h4>

By default, Plotly will create a new file when you call <code>Plotly.plot</code>.
To overwrite a graph, include <code>["filename" => "basic-line", "fileopt" => "overwrite"]</code>
as the last argument:

<div class="z-depth-1">
<pre>using Plotly

trace1 = [
  "x" => [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "y" => [10, 15, 13, 17],
  "type" => "scatter"
]
trace2 = [
  "x" => [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "y" => [16, 5, 11, 9],
  "type" => "scatter"
]
data = [trace1, trace2]
response = Plotly.plot(data, ["filename" => "basic-line", "fileopt" => "overwrite"])
plot_url = response["url"]</pre>
</div>

If a graph named "basic-line" already exists in your account, then it will be overwritten
with this new version and the URL of the graph will persist.

<h4>Saving to a folder</h4>

Filenames that contain <code>"/"</code> be treated as a Plotly directory and will be saved to
your Plotly account in a folder tree.

For example, to save your graphs to the folder <code>my-graphs</code>:

<pre>Plotly.plot(data, ["filename" => "my-graphs/basic-line", "fileopt" => "overwrite"])</pre>

If the folder doesn't exist, it will be created.

<h4>Creating new files</h4>

<div class="z-depth-1">
<pre>using Plotly

trace1 = [
  "x" => [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "y" => [10, 15, 13, 17],
  "type" => "scatter"
]
trace2 = [
  "x" => [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "y" => [16, 5, 11, 9],
  "type" => "scatter"
]
data = [trace1, trace2]
response = Plotly.plot(data, ["filename" => "basic-line", "fileopt" => "new"])
plot_url = response["url"]</pre>
</div>

With <code>fileopt='new'</code>, Plotly will always create a new file. If a
file with the same name already exists, then Plotly will append a '(1)' to the end
of the filename, e.g. <code>basic-line (1)</code> and create a unique URL.
