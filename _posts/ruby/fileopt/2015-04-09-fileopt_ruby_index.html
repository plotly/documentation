<h4>Overwriting existing graphs and updating a graph at its unique URL</h4>

By default, Plotly will overwrite files made with the same filename:

<div class="z-depth-1">
<pre>import plotly.plotly as py
from plotly.graph_objs import *

data = Data([
    Scatter(
        x=[1, 2],
        y=[3, 4]
    )
])

plot_url = py.plot(data, filename='my plot')</pre>
</div>

If a graph named 'my plot' already exists in your account, then it will be overwritten
with this new version and the URL of the graph will persist.


<h4>Saving to a folder</h4>

Filenames that contain <code>"/"</code> be treated as a Plotly directory and will be saved to
your Plotly account in a folder tree.

For example, to save your graphs to the folder <code>my-graphs</code>:

<pre>py.plot(data, filename='my-graphs/my plot')</pre>

If the folder doesn't exist, it will be created.


<h4>Creating new files</h4>

<div class="z-depth-1">
<pre>import plotly.plotly as py
from plotly.graph_objs import *

data = Data([
    Scatter(
        x=[1, 2],
        y=[3, 4]
    )
])

plot_url = py.plot(data, filename='new plot', fileopt='new')</pre>
</div>

With <code>fileopt='new'</code>, Plotly will always create a new file. If a
file with the same name already exists, then Plotly will append a '(1)' to the end
of the filename, e.g. <code>new plot (1)</code> and create a unique URL.


<h4>Extending traces in an existing graph</h4>

<code>fileopt='extend'</code> will extend existing traces with your new data.
If you need need to update your graphs in real-time (more frequently than once a minute),
then <a href="https://plot.ly/ruby/streaming">use the streaming API</a>.

<h6>Example</h6>

<div class="z-depth-1">
<pre>import plotly.plotly as py
from plotly.graph_objs import *

trace0 = Scatter(
    x=[1, 2],
    y=[1, 2]
)

trace1 = Scatter(
    x=[1, 2],
    y=[2, 3]
)

trace2 = Scatter(
    x=[1, 2],
    y=[3, 4]
)

data = Data([trace0, trace1, trace2])

# Take 1: if there is no data in the plot, 'extend' will create new traces.
plot_url = py.plot(data, filename='extend plot', fileopt='extend')</pre>
</div>

Then, extend the traces with more data.

<div class="z-depth-1">
<pre>import plotly.plotly as py
from plotly.graph_objs import *

trace0 = Scatter(
    x=[3, 4],
    y=[2, 1]
)

trace1 = Scatter(
    x=[3, 4],
    y=[3, 2]
)

trace2 = Scatter(
    x=[3, 4],
    y=[4, 3]
)

data = Data([trace0, trace1, trace2])

# Take 2: extend the traces on the plot with the data in the order supplied.
plot_url = py.plot(data, filename='extend plot', fileopt='extend')</pre>
</div>
