    "With the UK general election in early May 2015, we thought it would be a fun exercise to demonstrate how you can investigate market price action over historial elections. We shall be using Python, together with Plotly for plotting. Plotly is a free web-based platform for making graphs. You can keep graphs private, make them public, and run Plotly on your [Chart Studio Enterprise on your own servers](https://plot.ly/product/enterprise/). You can find more details [here](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/)."

    "To get market data, we shall be using Bloomberg. As a starting point, we have used bbg_py from [Brian Smith's TIA project](https://github.com/bpsmith/tia/tree/master/tia/bbg), which allows you to access Bloomberg via COM (older method), modifying it to make it compatible for Python 3.4. Whilst, we shall note use it to access historical daily data, there are functions which enable us to download intraday data. This method is only compatible with 32 bit versions of Python and assumes you are running the code on a Bloomberg terminal (it won't work without a valid Bloomberg licence).\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion a better way to access Bloomberg via Python, is via the official Bloomberg open source Python Open Source Graphing Library, however, at time of writing the official version is not yet compatible with Python 3.4. Fil Mackay has created a Python 3.4 compatible version of this [here](https://github.com/filmackay/blpapi-py), which I have used successfully. Whilst it takes slightly more time to configure (and compile using Windows SDK 7.1), it has the benefit of being compatible with 64 bit Python, which I have found invaluable in my analysis (have a read of [this](http://ta.speot.is/2012/04/09/visual-studio-2010-sp1-windows-sdk-7-1-install-order/) in case of failed installations of Windows SDK 7.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Quandl can be used as an alternative data source, if you don't have access to a Bloomberg terminal, which I have also included in the code."
