    "#### About Apache Spark\n",
    "[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)'s meteoric rise has been incredible. It is one of the fastest growing open source projects and is a perfect fit for the graphing tools that [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) provides. Plotly's ability to graph and share images from [Spark DataFrames](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html) quickly and easily make it a great tool for any data scientist and [Chart Studio Enterprise](https://plot.ly/product/enterprise/) make it easy to securely host and share those Plotly graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will go over the details of getting set up with IPython Notebooks for graphing Spark data with Plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a Profile\n",
    "First you'll have to create an ipython profile for pyspark, you can do this locally or you can do it on the cluster that you're running Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start off by creating a new ipython profile. (Spark should have ipython install but you may need to install ipython notebook yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "ipython profile create pyspark\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next you'll have to edit some configurations. Spark/Hadoop have plenty of ports that they open up so you'll have to change the below file to avoid any conflicts that might come up. \n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "~/.ipython/profile_pyspark/ipython_notebook_config.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not running Spark locally, you'll have to add some other configurations. [Cloudera's blog](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/08/how-to-use-ipython-notebook-with-apache-spark/) has a great post about some of the other things you can add, like passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython's documentation also has some excellent recommendations for settings that you can find on [the \"Securing a Notebook Server\" post on ipython.org.](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/public_server.html#running-a-notebook-server)\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll likely want to set a port, and an IP address to be able to access the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next you'll need to set a couple of environmental variables. You can do this at the command line or you can set it up in your computer's/master node's bash_rc/bash_profile files.\n",
