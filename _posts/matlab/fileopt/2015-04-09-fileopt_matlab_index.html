<h4>Specifying filenames, overwriting files, and updating graphs at their unique URLs</h4>

By default, Plotly will create a new file when you call <code>fig2plotly</code>.
To overwrite a graph, include <code>'filename', 'my-graph'</code>
as the last arguments:
<br>
<br>
<div class="z-depth-1">
<pre style="background: rgb(240, 240, 250);">x = linspace(-2*pi,2*pi);
y1 = sin(x);
y2 = cos(x);

fig = figure;
plot(x,y1,x,y2);

response = fig2plotly(fig, 'filename', 'matlab-basic-line');
plotly_url = response.url;</pre>
</div>
<br>
If a graph named "matlab-basic-line" already exists in your account, then it will be overwritten
with this new version and the URL of the graph will persist.

<h4>Saving to a folder</h4>

Filenames that contain <code>"/"</code> be treated as a Plotly directory and will be saved to
your Plotly account in a folder tree.

For example, to save your graphs to the folder <code>my-graphs</code>:
<br>
<br>
<pre style="background: rgb(240, 240, 250);">fig2plotly(fig, 'filename', 'my-graphs/matlab-basic-line');</pre>
<br>
If the folder doesn't exist, it will be created.

<h4>Updating graphs in real-time</h4>

Plotly graphs can also be updated in real-time with MATLAB. For more, see our <a href="https://plot.ly/matlab/streaming/">Streaming API for MATLAB</a>.

<h4>Creating new files</h4>

<div class="z-depth-1">
<pre style="background: rgb(240, 240, 250);">x = linspace(-2*pi,2*pi);
y1 = sin(x);
y2 = cos(x);

fig = figure;
plot(x,y1,x,y2);

response = fig2plotly(fig);
plotly_url = response.url;</pre>
</div>
<br>
Without specifying a filename, Plotly will always create a new file. If a
file with the same name already exists, then Plotly will append a '(1)' to the end
of the filename, e.g. <code>basic-line (1)</code> and create a unique URL.
