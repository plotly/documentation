    "- `grid` (Grid Object): the actual grid object that you are uploading.\n",
    "- `filename` (str): name of the grid in your plotly account,\n",
    "- `world_readable` (bool): if `True`, the grid is `public` and can be viewed by anyone in your files. If `False`, it is private and can only be viewed by you.\n",
