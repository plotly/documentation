 |      data
 |          The &#39;data&#39; property is a tuple of trace instances
 |          that may be specified as:
 |            - A list or tuple of trace instances
 |              (e.g. [Scatter(...), Bar(...)])
 |            - A list or tuple of dicts of string/value properties where:
 |              - The &#39;type&#39; property specifies the trace type
 |                  One of: [&#39;area&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;box&#39;, &#39;candlestick&#39;, &#39;carpet&#39;,
 |                           &#39;choropleth&#39;, &#39;cone&#39;, &#39;contour&#39;,

 |                           &#39;violin&#39;]
 |      
 |              - All remaining properties are passed to the constructor of
 |                the specified trace type
 |      
 |              (e.g. [{&#39;type&#39;: &#39;scatter&#39;, ...}, {&#39;type&#39;: &#39;bar, ...}])
 |      layout
 |          The &#39;layout&#39; property is an instance of Layout
 |          that may be specified as:
 |            - An instance of plotly.graph_objs.Layout
 |            - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
 |              to the Layout constructor
 |      
 |              Supported dict properties:
 |                  
 |                  angularaxis
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.AngularAxis instance
 |                      or dict with compatible properties
 |                  annotations
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Annotation instance or
 |                      dict with compatible properties
 |                  autosize
 |                      Determines whether or not a layout width or
 |                      height that has been left undefined by the user
 |                      is initialized on each relayout. Note that,
 |                      regardless of this attribute, an undefined
 |                      layout width or height is always initialized on
 |                      the first call to plot.
 |                  bargap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
 |                      adjacent location coordinates.
 |                  bargroupgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
 |                      the same location coordinate.
 |                  barmode
 |                      Determines how bars at the same location
 |                      coordinate are displayed on the graph. With
 |                      *stack*, the bars are stacked on top of one
 |                      another With *relative*, the bars are stacked
 |                      on top of one another, with negative values
 |                      below the axis, positive values above With
 |                      *group*, the bars are plotted next to one
 |                      another centered around the shared location.
 |                      With *overlay*, the bars are plotted over one
 |                      another, you might need to an *opacity* to see
 |                      multiple bars.
 |                  barnorm
 |                      Sets the normalization for bar traces on the
 |                      graph. With *fraction*, the value of each bar
 |                      is divide by the sum of the values at the
 |                      location coordinate. With *percent*, the
 |                      results form *fraction* are presented in
 |                      percents.
 |                  boxgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes
 |                      of adjacent location coordinates.
 |                  boxgroupgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes
 |                      of the same location coordinate.
 |                  boxmode
 |                      Determines how boxes at the same location
 |                      coordinate are displayed on the graph. If
 |                      *group*, the boxes are plotted next to one
 |                      another centered around the shared location. If
 |                      *overlay*, the boxes are plotted over one
 |                      another, you might need to set *opacity* to see
 |                      them multiple boxes.
 |                  calendar
 |                      Sets the default calendar system to use for
 |                      interpreting and displaying dates throughout
 |                      the plot.
 |                  colorway
 |                      Sets the default trace colors.
 |                  datarevision
 |                      If provided, a changed value tells
 |                      `Plotly.react` that one or more data arrays has
 |                      changed. This way you can modify arrays in-
 |                      place rather than making a complete new copy
 |                      for an incremental change. If NOT provided,
 |                      `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are
 |                      being treated as immutable, thus any data array
 |                      with a different identity from its predecessor
 |                      contains new data.
 |                  direction
 |                      For polar plots only. Sets the direction
 |                      corresponding to positive angles.

 |                      Determines the mode of drag interactions.
 |                      *select* and *lasso* apply only to scatter
 |                      traces with markers or text. *orbit* and
 |                      *turntable* apply only to 3D scenes.
 |                  font
 |                      Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in
 |                      traces and other layout components inherit from
 |                      the global font.

 |                      Determines whether or not a text link citing
 |                      the data source is placed at the bottom-right
 |                      cored of the figure. Has only an effect only on
 |                      graphs that have been generated via forked
 |                      graphs from the plotly service (at

 |                  hoverdistance
 |                      Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look
 |                      for data to add hover labels (-1 means no
 |                      cutoff, 0 means no looking for data). This is
 |                      only a real distance for hovering on point-like
 |                      objects, like scatter points. For area-like
 |                      objects (bars, scatter fills, etc) hovering is
 |                      on inside the area and off outside, but these
 |                      objects will not supersede hover on point-like
 |                      objects in case of conflict.

 |                      When &#34;dragmode&#34; is set to &#34;select&#34;, this limits
 |                      the selection of the drag to horizontal,
 |                      vertical or diagonal. &#34;h&#34; only allows

 |                  separators
 |                      Sets the decimal and thousand separators. For
 |                      example, *. * puts a &#39;.&#39; before decimals and a
 |                      space between thousands. In English locales,

 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc

 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,

 |      
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be

 |      exactly at the positions given by `x`, `y` and `z`.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      anchor
 |          Sets the cones&#39; anchor with respect to their x/y/z
 |          positions. Note that *cm* denote the cone&#39;s center of
 |          mass which corresponds to 1/4 from the tail to tip.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Has an effect only if `color` is set to a numerical
 |          array. Determines whether the colorscale is a default
 |          palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette
 |          determined by `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is
 |          unspecified or `autocolorscale` is true, the default
 |          palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in
 |          the `color` array are all positive, all negative or
 |          mixed.
 |      cauto
 |          Has an effect only if `color` is set to a numerical
 |          array and `cmin`, `cmax` are set by the user. In this
 |          case, it controls whether the range of colors in
 |          `colorscale` is mapped to the range of values in the
 |          `color` array (`cauto: true`), or the `cmin`/`cmax`
 |          values (`cauto: false`). Defaults to `false` when
 |          `cmin`, `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Has an effect only if `color` is set to a numerical
 |          array. Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value
 |          should be associated to the `color` array index, and if
 |          set, `cmin` must be set as well.
 |      cmin
 |          Has an effect only if `color` is set to a numerical
 |          array. Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value
 |          should be associated to the `color` array index, and if
 |          set, `cmax` must be set as well.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.cone.ColorBar instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale and only has an effect if `color`
 |          is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an
 |          array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to
 |          an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At
 |          minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1)
 |          values are required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;,
 |          [1, &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use `cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys, YlGnBu, Greens,
 |          YlOrRd, Bluered, RdBu, Reds, Blues, Picnic, Rainbow,
 |          Portland, Jet, Hot, Blackbody, Earth, Electric,
 |          Viridis, Cividis
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in

 |          the vector field) or as *absolute* value (in the same
 |          units as the vector field).
 |      sizeref
 |          Adjusts the cone size scaling. The size of the cones is
 |          determined by their u/v/w norm multiplied a factor and

 |          corresponds to the minimum &#34;time&#34; to travel across two
 |          successive x/y/z positions at the average velocity of
 |          those two successive positions. All cones in a given
 |          trace use the same factor. With `sizemode` set to
 |          *scaled*, `sizeref` is unitless, its default value is
 |          *0.5* With `sizemode` set to *absolute*, `sizeref` has
 |          the same units as the u/v/w vector field, its the

 |      Add a new Heatmap trace
 |      
 |      The data that describes the heatmap value-to-color mapping is
 |      set in `z`. Data in `z` can either be a {2D array} of values
 |      (ragged or not) or a 1D array of values. In the case where `z`
 |      is a {2D array}, say that `z` has N rows and M columns. Then,
 |      by default, the resulting heatmap will have N partitions along
 |      the y axis and M partitions along the x axis. In other words,
 |      the i-th row/ j-th column cell in `z` is mapped to the i-th
 |      partition of the y axis (starting from the bottom of the plot)
 |      and the j-th partition of the x-axis (starting from the left of
 |      the plot). This behavior can be flipped by using `transpose`.
 |      Moreover, `x` (`y`) can be provided with M or M+1 (N or N+1)
 |      elements. If M (N), then the coordinates correspond to the
 |      center of the heatmap cells and the cells have equal width. If
 |      M+1 (N+1), then the coordinates correspond to the edges of the
 |      heatmap cells. In the case where `z` is a 1D {array}, the x and
 |      y coordinates must be provided in `x` and `y` respectively to
 |      form data triplets.

 |      horizontally spanning histograms. Binning options are set
 |      `xbins` and `ybins` respectively if no aggregation data is
 |      provided.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autobinx
 |          Determines whether or not the x axis bin attributes are
 |          picked by an algorithm. Note that this should be set to

 |          using the attributes in xbins.
 |      autobiny
 |          Determines whether or not the y axis bin attributes are
 |          picked by an algorithm. Note that this should be set to

 |          with compatible properties
 |      histfunc
 |          Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
 |          trace. If *count*, the histogram values are computed by

 |          number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
 |          the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
 |          the total number of sample points). If *probability
 |          density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the

 |      nbinsy
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This

 |          Determines whether or not the y axis bin attributes are
 |          picked by an algorithm. Note that this should be set to
 |          false if you want to manually set the number of bins
 |          using the attributes in ybins.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether or not the colorscale is picked
 |          using the sign of the input z values.
 |      autocontour
 |          Determines whether or not the contour level attributes
 |          are picked by an algorithm. If *true*, the number of
 |          contour levels can be set in `ncontours`. If *false*,
 |          set the contour level attributes in `contours`.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.ColorBar instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in z space, use zmin and zmax
 |      contours
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.Contours instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when

 |          trace. If *count*, the histogram values are computed by
 |          counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
 |          *sum*, *avg*, *min*, *max*, the histogram values are
 |          computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
 |          maximum of the values lying inside each bin
 |          respectively.
 |      histnorm
 |          Specifies the type of normalization used for this
 |          histogram trace. If **, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
 |          number of data points lying inside the bins). If
 |          *percent* / *probability*, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
 |          with respect to the total number of sample points
 |          (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
 |          *density*, the span of each bar corresponds to the
 |          number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
 |          the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
 |          the total number of sample points). If *probability
 |          density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
 |          probability that an event will fall into the
 |          corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
 |          equals 1).

 |          visualizes the distribution of the data.
 |      nbinsy
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This

 |      Add a new Mesh3d trace
 |      
 |      Draws sets of triangles with coordinates given by three
 |      1-dimensional arrays in `x`, `y`, `z` and (1) a sets of `i`,
 |      `j`, `k` indices (2) Delaunay triangulation or (3) the Alpha-
 |      shape algorithm or (4) the Convex-hull algorithm
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      alphahull
 |          Determines how the mesh surface triangles are derived
 |          from the set of vertices (points) represented by the
 |          `x`, `y` and `z` arrays, if the `i`, `j`, `k` arrays
 |          are not supplied. For general use of `mesh3d` it is
 |          preferred that `i`, `j`, `k` are supplied. If *-1*,
 |          Delaunay triangulation is used, which is mainly
 |          suitable if the mesh is a single, more or less layer
 |          surface that is perpendicular to `delaunayaxis`. In
 |          case the `delaunayaxis` intersects the mesh surface at
 |          more than one point it will result triangles that are
 |          very long in the dimension of `delaunayaxis`. If *&gt;0*,
 |          the alpha-shape algorithm is used. In this case, the
 |          positive `alphahull` value signals the use of the
 |          alpha-shape algorithm, _and_ its value acts as the
 |          parameter for the mesh fitting. If *0*,  the convex-
 |          hull algorithm is used. It is suitable for convex
 |          bodies or if the intention is to enclose the `x`, `y`
 |          and `z` point set into a convex hull.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Has an effect only if `color` is set to a numerical
 |          array. Determines whether the colorscale is a default
 |          palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette
 |          determined by `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is
 |          unspecified or `autocolorscale` is true, the default
 |          palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in
 |          the `color` array are all positive, all negative or
 |          mixed.
 |      cauto
 |          Has an effect only if `color` is set to a numerical
 |          array and `cmin`, `cmax` are set by the user. In this
 |          case, it controls whether the range of colors in
 |          `colorscale` is mapped to the range of values in the
 |          `color` array (`cauto: true`), or the `cmin`/`cmax`
 |          values (`cauto: false`). Defaults to `false` when
 |          `cmin`, `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Has an effect only if `color` is set to a numerical
 |          array. Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value
 |          should be associated to the `color` array index, and if
 |          set, `cmin` must be set as well.
 |      cmin
 |          Has an effect only if `color` is set to a numerical
 |          array. Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value
 |          should be associated to the `color` array index, and if
 |          set, `cmax` must be set as well.
 |      color
 |          Sets the color of the whole mesh
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.mesh3d.ColorBar instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale and only has an effect if `color`
 |          is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an
 |          array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to
 |          an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At
 |          minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1)
 |          values are required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;,
 |          [1, &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use `cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys, YlGnBu, Greens,
 |          YlOrRd, Bluered, RdBu, Reds, Blues, Picnic, Rainbow,
 |          Portland, Jet, Hot, Blackbody, Earth, Electric,
 |          Viridis, Cividis
 |      contour
 |          plotly.graph_objs.mesh3d.Contour instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      delaunayaxis
 |          Sets the Delaunay axis, which is the axis that is
 |          perpendicular to the surface of the Delaunay
 |          triangulation. It has an effect if `i`, `j`, `k` are
 |          not provided and `alphahull` is set to indicate
 |          Delaunay triangulation.
 |      facecolor
 |          Sets the color of each face Overrides *color* and
 |          *vertexcolor*.
 |      facecolorsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  facecolor .
 |      flatshading
 |          Determines whether or not normal smoothing is applied
 |          to the meshes, creating meshes with an angular, low-
 |          poly look via flat reflections.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.mesh3d.Hoverlabel instance or dict

 |      i
 |          A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between
 |          0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing
 |          the *first* vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],
 |          j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in
 |          the mesh, where `i[m] = n` points to the triplet
 |          `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,
 |          each element in `i` represents a point in space, which
 |          is the first vertex of a triangle.
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an

 |          0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing
 |          the *second* vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],
 |          j[m], k[m]}`  together represent face m (triangle m) in
 |          the mesh, where `j[m] = n` points to the triplet
 |          `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,
 |          each element in `j` represents a point in space, which
 |          is the second vertex of a triangle.
 |      jsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  j .
 |      k
 |          A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between
 |          0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing
 |          the *third* vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],
 |          j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in
 |          the mesh, where `k[m] = n` points to the triplet
 |          `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,
 |          each element in `k` represents a point in space, which
 |          is the third vertex of a triangle.
 |      ksrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  k .

 |      reversescale
 |          Has an effect only if `color` is set to a numerical
 |          array. Reverses the color mapping if true (`cmin` will
 |          correspond to the last color in the array and `cmax`
 |          will correspond to the first color).
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If *scene* (the default value),

 |          *scene2*, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.

 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

 |          or greater than the number of points. For the best
 |          performance and memory use, create one large `indices`
 |          typed array that is guaranteed to be at least as long
 |          as the largest number of points during use, and reuse

 |      Add a new Scatter trace
 |      
 |      The scatter trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts,
 |      text charts, and bubble charts. The data visualized as scatter
 |      point or lines is set in `x` and `y`. Text (appearing either on
 |      the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble charts are
 |      achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to
 |      numerical arrays.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note

 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      dx
 |          Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
 |      dy

 |          compatible properties
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with
 |          `fillcolor` if not *none*. *tozerox* and *tozeroy* fill
 |          to x=0 and y=0 respectively. *tonextx* and *tonexty*
 |          fill between the endpoints of this trace and the
 |          endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like *tozerox* and *tozeroy*. *toself* connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. *tonext* fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          *toself* if there is no trace before it. *tonext*
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Hoverlabel instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is *toself* or *tonext* and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is *fills*,
 |          otherwise it is *points*.
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a *text* flag.
 |      hovertextsrc

 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points, then the default is *lines+markers*.
 |          Otherwise, *lines*.

 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements

 |          to x=0 and y=0 respectively. *tonextx* and *tonexty*
 |          fill between the endpoints of this trace and the
 |          endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like *tozerox* and *tozeroy*. *toself* connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. *tonext* fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          *toself* if there is no trace before it. *tonext*

 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is *toself* or *tonext* and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is *fills*,
 |          otherwise it is *points*.
 |      ids

 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with

 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. *tonext* fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          *toself* if there is no trace before it. *tonext*
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is *toself* or *tonext* and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is *fills*,
 |          otherwise it is *points*.
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a *text* flag.

 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like *tozerox* and *tozeroy*. *toself* connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. *tonext* fills the

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      a
 |          Sets the quantity of component `a` in each data point.
 |          If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all provided, they need not be
 |          normalized, only the relative values matter. If only
 |          two arrays are provided they must be normalized to
 |          match `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum`.
 |      asrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  a .
 |      b
 |          Sets the quantity of component `a` in each data point.
 |          If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all provided, they need not be

 |          two arrays are provided they must be normalized to
 |          match `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum`.
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      csrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  c .
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when

 |          the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the
 |          trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. *tonext*
 |          fills the space between two traces if one completely
 |          encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and
 |          behaves like *toself* if there is no trace before it.
 |          *tonext* should not be used if one trace does not
 |          enclose the other.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line

 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points

 |          regions? If the fill is *toself* or *tonext* and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is *fills*,
 |          otherwise it is *points*.
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (a,b,c)
 |          point. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of strings, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b,c).
 |          To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a *text*
 |          flag.

 |          the provided `mode` includes *text* then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points, then the default is *lines+markers*.
 |          Otherwise, *lines*.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.

 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

 |      sum
 |          The number each triplet should sum to, if only two of
 |          `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided. This overrides
 |          `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum` to normalize this specific trace, but
 |          does not affect the values displayed on the axes. 0 (or
 |          missing) means to use ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (a,b,c) point.
 |          If a single string, the same string appears over all
 |          the data points. If an array of strings, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b,c). If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a *text* flag and
 |          *hovertext* is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.

 |      Add a new Violin trace
 |      
 |      In vertical (horizontal) violin plots, statistics are computed
 |      using `y` (`x`) values. By supplying an `x` (`y`) array, one
 |      violin per distinct x (y) value is drawn If no `x` (`y`)
 |      {array} is provided, a single violin is drawn. That violin
 |      position is then positioned with with `name` or with `x0`
 |      (`y0`) if provided.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      bandwidth
 |          Sets the bandwidth used to compute the kernel density

 |          compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.violin.Hoverlabel instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual violins or
 |          sample points or the kernel density estimate or any
 |          combination of them?
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object

 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      jitter
 |          Sets the amount of jitter in the sample points drawn.
 |          If *0*, the sample points align along the distribution
 |          axis. If *1*, the sample points are drawn in a random
 |          jitter of width equal to the width of the violins.
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when

 |          also be used for the position coordinate, if `x` and
 |          `x0` (`y` and `y0` if horizontal) are missing and the
 |          position axis is categorical
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the violin(s). If *v* (*h*),
 |          the distribution is visualized along the vertical
 |          (horizontal).
 |      pointpos
 |          Sets the position of the sample points in relation to
 |          the violins. If *0*, the sample points are places over
 |          the center of the violins. Positive (negative) values
 |          correspond to positions to the right (left) for
 |          vertical violins and above (below) for horizontal
 |          violins.
 |      points
 |          If *outliers*, only the sample points lying outside the

 |          If *false*, only the violins are shown with no sample
 |          points
 |      scalegroup
 |          If there are multiple violins that should be sized
 |          according to to some metric (see `scalemode`), link
 |          them by providing a non-empty group id here shared by
 |          every trace in the same group.
 |      scalemode
 |          Sets the metric by which the width of each violin is
 |          determined.*width* means each violin has the same (max)
 |          width*count* means the violins are scaled by the number
 |          of sample points makingup each violin.

 |          compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      side
 |          Determines on which side of the position value the
 |          density function making up one half of a violin is
 |          plotted. Useful when comparing two violin traces under
 |          *overlay* mode, where one trace has `side` set to
 |          *positive* and the other to *negative*.
 |      span
 |          Sets the span in data space for which the density
 |          function will be computed. Has an effect only when
 |          `spanmode` is set to *manual*.
 |      spanmode
 |          Sets the method by which the span in data space where
 |          the density function will be computed. *soft* means the
 |          span goes from the sample&#39;s minimum value minus two
 |          bandwidths to the sample&#39;s maximum value plus two
 |          bandwidths. *hard* means the span goes from the
 |          sample&#39;s minimum to its maximum value. For custom span
 |          settings, use mode *manual* and fill in the `span`
 |          attribute.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.violin.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each sample
 |          value. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a *text* flag.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |

 |          plotly.graph_objs.violin.Unselected instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x

 |          more info.
 |      x0
 |          Sets the x coordinate of the box. See overview for more
 |          info.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and

 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y sample data or coordinates. See overview for
 |          more info.
 |      y0
 |          Sets the y coordinate of the box. See overview for more

 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .

 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      Suppose we have a figure widget, `fig`, with a single trace.
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; import plotly.graph_objs as go
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = go.FigureWidget(data=[{&#39;y&#39;: [3, 4, 2]}])
 |      
 |      1) Animate a change in the xaxis and yaxis ranges using default
 |      duration and easing parameters.
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_animate():
 |      ...     fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      ...     fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |      
 |      2) Animate a change in the size and color of the trace&#39;s markers
 |      over 2 seconds using the elastic-in-out easing method
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_update(duration=2000, easing=&#39;elastic-in-out&#39;):
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.size = 20
 |  
 |  batch_update(*args, **kwds)
 |      A context manager that batches up trace and layout assignment
 |      operations into a singe plotly_update message that is executed when
 |      the context exits.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      For example, suppose we have a figure widget, `fig`, with a single
 |      trace.
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; import plotly.graph_objs as go
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = go.FigureWidget(data=[{&#39;y&#39;: [3, 4, 2]}])
 |      
 |      If we want to update the xaxis range, the yaxis range, and the
 |      marker color, we could do so using a series of three property
 |      assignments as follows:
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |      
 |      This will work, however it will result in three messages being
 |      sent to the front end (two relayout messages for the axis range
 |      updates followed by one restyle message for the marker color
 |      update). This can cause the plot to appear to stutter as the
 |      three updates are applied incrementally.
 |      
 |      We can avoid this problem by performing these three assignments in a
 |      `batch_update` context as follows:
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_update():
 |      ...     fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      ...     fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |      
 |      Now, these three property updates will be sent to the frontend in a
 |      single update message, and they will be applied by the front end
 |      simultaneously.
 |  
 |  plotly_relayout(self, relayout_data, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a Plotly relayout operation on the figure&#39;s layout
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      relayout_data : dict
 |          Dict of layout updates
 |      
 |          dict keys are strings that specify the properties to be updated.
 |          Nested properties are expressed by joining successive keys on
 |          &#39;.&#39; characters (e.g. &#39;xaxis.range&#39;)
 |      
 |          dict values are the values to use to update the layout.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |  
 |  plotly_restyle(self, restyle_data, trace_indexes=None, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a Plotly restyle operation on the figure&#39;s traces
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      restyle_data : dict
 |          Dict of trace style updates.
 |      
 |          Keys are strings that specify the properties to be updated.
 |          Nested properties are expressed by joining successive keys on
 |          &#39;.&#39; characters (e.g. &#39;marker.color&#39;).
 |      
 |          Values may be scalars or lists. When values are scalars,
 |          that scalar value is applied to all traces specified by the
 |          `trace_indexes` parameter.  When values are lists,
 |          the restyle operation will cycle through the elements
 |          of the list as it cycles through the traces specified by the
 |          `trace_indexes` parameter.
 |      
 |          Caution: To use plotly_restyle to update a list property (e.g.
 |          the `x` property of the scatter trace), the property value
 |          should be a scalar list containing the list to update with. For
 |          example, the following command would be used to update the &#39;x&#39;
 |          property of the first trace to the list [1, 2, 3]
 |      
 |          &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.plotly_restyle({&#39;x&#39;: [[1, 2, 3]]}, 0)
 |      
 |      trace_indexes : int or list of int
 |          Trace index, or list of trace indexes, that the restyle operation
 |          applies to. Defaults to all trace indexes.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |  
 |  plotly_update(self, restyle_data=None, relayout_data=None, trace_indexes=None, **kwargs)

 |  
 |  observe(self, handler, names=traitlets.All, type=&#39;change&#39;)
 |      Setup a handler to be called when a trait changes.
 |      
 |      This is used to setup dynamic notifications of trait changes.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      handler : callable
 |          A callable that is called when a trait changes. Its
 |          signature should be ``handler(change)``, where ``change`` is a
 |          dictionary. The change dictionary at least holds a &#39;type&#39; key.
 |          * ``type``: the type of notification.
 |          Other keys may be passed depending on the value of &#39;type&#39;. In the
 |          case where type is &#39;change&#39;, we also have the following keys:
 |          * ``owner`` : the HasTraits instance
 |          * ``old`` : the old value of the modified trait attribute
 |          * ``new`` : the new value of the modified trait attribute
 |          * ``name`` : the name of the modified trait attribute.
 |      names : list, str, All
 |          If names is All, the handler will apply to all traits.  If a list
 |          of str, handler will apply to all names in the list.  If a
 |          str, the handler will apply just to that name.
 |      type : str, All (default: &#39;change&#39;)
 |          The type of notification to filter by. If equal to All, then all
 |          notifications are passed to the observe handler.
 |  
 |  on_trait_change(self, handler=None, name=None, remove=False)
 |      DEPRECATED: Setup a handler to be called when a trait changes.
 |      
 |      This is used to setup dynamic notifications of trait changes.
 |      
 |      Static handlers can be created by creating methods on a HasTraits
 |      subclass with the naming convention &#39;_[traitname]_changed&#39;.  Thus,
 |      to create static handler for the trait &#39;a&#39;, create the method
 |      _a_changed(self, name, old, new) (fewer arguments can be used, see
 |      below).
 |      
 |      If `remove` is True and `handler` is not specified, all change
 |      handlers for the specified name are uninstalled.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      handler : callable, None
 |          A callable that is called when a trait changes.  Its
 |          signature can be handler(), handler(name), handler(name, new),
 |          handler(name, old, new), or handler(name, old, new, self).
 |      name : list, str, None
 |          If None, the handler will apply to all traits.  If a list
 |          of str, handler will apply to all names in the list.  If a
 |          str, the handler will apply just to that name.
 |      remove : bool
 |          If False (the default), then install the handler.  If True
 |          then unintall it.
 |  
 |  set_trait(self, name, value)
 |      Forcibly sets trait attribute, including read-only attributes.
 |  
 |  setup_instance(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  trait_metadata(self, traitname, key, default=None)
 |      Get metadata values for trait by key.
 |  
 |  trait_names(self, **metadata)
 |      Get a list of all the names of this class&#39; traits.
 |  
 |  traits(self, **metadata)
 |      Get a ``dict`` of all the traits of this class.  The dictionary
 |      is keyed on the name and the values are the TraitType objects.
 |      
 |      The TraitTypes returned don&#39;t know anything about the values
 |      that the various HasTrait&#39;s instances are holding.
 |      
 |      The metadata kwargs allow functions to be passed in which
 |      filter traits based on metadata values.  The functions should
 |      take a single value as an argument and return a boolean.  If
 |      any function returns False, then the trait is not included in
 |      the output.  If a metadata key doesn&#39;t exist, None will be passed
 |      to the function.
 |  
 |  unobserve(self, handler, names=traitlets.All, type=&#39;change&#39;)
 |      Remove a trait change handler.
 |      
 |      This is used to unregister handlers to trait change notifications.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      handler : callable
 |          The callable called when a trait attribute changes.
 |      names : list, str, All (default: All)
 |          The names of the traits for which the specified handler should be
 |          uninstalled. If names is All, the specified handler is uninstalled
 |          from the list of notifiers corresponding to all changes.
 |      type : str or All (default: &#39;change&#39;)
 |          The type of notification to filter by. If All, the specified handler
 |          is uninstalled from the list of notifiers corresponding to all types.
 |  
 |  unobserve_all(self, name=traitlets.All)
 |      Remove trait change handlers of any type for the specified name.
 |      If name is not specified, removes all trait notifiers.

 |      Get a dict of all event handlers defined on this class, not a parent.
 |      
 |      Works like ``event_handlers``, except for excluding traits from parents.
 |  
 |  class_own_traits(cls, **metadata) from traitlets.traitlets.MetaHasTraits
 |      Get a dict of all the traitlets defined on this class, not a parent.
 |      
 |      Works like `class_traits`, except for excluding traits from parents.
 |  
 |  class_trait_names(cls, **metadata) from traitlets.traitlets.MetaHasTraits
 |      Get a list of all the names of this class&#39; traits.
 |      
 |      This method is just like the :meth:`trait_names` method,
 |      but is unbound.
 |  
 |  class_traits(cls, **metadata) from traitlets.traitlets.MetaHasTraits
 |      Get a ``dict`` of all the traits of this class.  The dictionary
 |      is keyed on the name and the values are the TraitType objects.
 |      
 |      This method is just like the :meth:`traits` method, but is unbound.
 |      
 |      The TraitTypes returned don&#39;t know anything about the values
 |      that the various HasTrait&#39;s instances are holding.
 |      
 |      The metadata kwargs allow functions to be passed in which
 |      filter traits based on metadata values.  The functions should
 |      take a single value as an argument and return a boolean.  If
 |      any function returns False, then the trait is not included in
 |      the output.  If a metadata key doesn&#39;t exist, None will be passed
 |      to the function.
 |  
 |  trait_events(cls, name=None) from traitlets.traitlets.MetaHasTraits
 |      Get a ``dict`` of all the event handlers of this class.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      name: str (default: None)
 |          The name of a trait of this class. If name is ``None`` then all
 |          the event handlers of this class will be returned instead.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      The event handlers associated with a trait name, or all event handlers.
