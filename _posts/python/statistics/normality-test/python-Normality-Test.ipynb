    "\n",
    "Each test will return at least two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Statistic_**: A quantity calculated by the test that can be interpreted in the context of the test via comparing it to critical values from the distribution of the test statistic.\n",
    "- **_p-value_**: Used to interpret the test, in this case whether the sample was drawn from a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each test calculates a test-specific statistic. This statistic can aid in the interpretation of the result, although it may require a deeper proficiency with statistics and a deeper knowledge of the specific statistical test. Instead, the p-value can be used to quickly and accurately interpret the statistic in practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests assume that that the sample was drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Technically this is called the null hypothesis, or H0. A threshold level is chosen called alpha, typically 5% (or 0.05), that is used to interpret the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SciPy implementation of these tests, you can interpret the p value as follows.\n",
    " - **_p <= alpha_**: reject H0, not normal.\n",
    " - **_p > alpha_**: fail to reject H0, normal.\n",
    " \n",
    "This means that, in general, we are seeking results with a larger p-value to confirm that our sample was likely drawn from a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A result above 5% does not mean that the null hypothesis is true. It means that it is very likely true given available evidence. The p-value is not the probability of the data fitting a Gaussian distribution; it can be thought of as a value that helps us interpret the statistical test."

    "**_How to interpret the results?_**\n",
    "   - Your data may not be normal for many different reasons. Each test looks at the question of whether a sample was drawn from a Gaussian distribution from a slightly different perspective.\n",
    "   - Investigate why your data is not normal and perhaps use data preparation techniques to normalize the data.\n",
    "   - Start looking into the use of nonparametric statistical methods instead of the parametric methods.\n",
    "   - If some of the methods suggest that the sample is Gaussian and some not, then perhaps take this as an indication that your data is Gaussian-like.\n",
