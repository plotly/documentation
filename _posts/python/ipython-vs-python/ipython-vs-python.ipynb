    "[**Python**](https://www.python.org/) is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. It is now one of the most popular languages in the world. It is routinely used by system administrators and web developers. Also, many scientists are using Python thanks to libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and matplotlib. The ease of use of Python and its dynamic nature make it a very productive language."

On the contrary, with IPython, you generally write one command at a time and you get the results instantly. This is a completely different way of working with Python. When analyzing data or running computational models, you need this sort of interactivity to explore them efficiently."
