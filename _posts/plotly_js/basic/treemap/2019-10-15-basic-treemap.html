   [Treemap charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping) visualize hierarchical data using nested rectangles. Same as [Sunburst](https://plot.ly/javascript/sunburst-charts/) the hierarchy is defined by [labels](https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#treemap-labels) and [parents](https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#treemap-parents) attributes. Click on one sector to zoom in/out, which also displays a pathbar in the upper-left corner of your treemap. To zoom out you can use the path bar as well.
