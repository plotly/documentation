    The word "mapbox" in the trace names and `layout.mapbox` refers to the Mapbox.js open-source library. If your basemap in `layout.mapbox.style` uses data from the Mapbox *service*, then you will need to register for a free account at https://mapbox.com/ and obtain a Mapbox Access token. This token should be provided either in `mapboxAccessToken`  in `setPlotConfig` function, or as a variable that would be passed as an argument of `newPlot`.
    If your `layout.mapbox.style` does not use data from the Mapbox service, you do *not* need to register for a Mapbox account.
