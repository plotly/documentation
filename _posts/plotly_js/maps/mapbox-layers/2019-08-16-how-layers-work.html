    If your figure contains one or more traces of type `Scattermapbox`, `Choroplethmapbox` or `Densitymapbox`, the `layout` object in your figure contains configuration information for the map itself. The map is composed of various layers, of three different types.
    <ol>
        <li> `layout.mapbox.style` defines the lowest layers, also known as your "base map"</li>
        <li> The various traces in `data` are by default rendered above the base map (although this can be controlled via the `below` attribute).</li>
        <li> `layout.mapbox.layers` is an array that defines more layers that are by default rendered above the traces in `data` (although this can also be controlled via the `below` attribute).</li>
    </ol>
