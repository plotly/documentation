  When an event (for example a click or hover) occurs on a Plotly graph, event data is emitted. Event data is information about the data point related to the event (i.e. the point clicked). Event data differs depending on the type of plot the user is interacting with. The event data for Cartesian (2D) plots is returned as follows:

{
  points: [{
    curveNumber: 1,  // index in data of the trace associated with the selected point
    pointNumber: 1,  // index of the selected point
    x: 1,        // x value
    y: 1,      // y value
    data: {/* */},       // ref to the trace as sent to Plotly.plot associated with the selected point
    fullData: {/* */},   // ref to the trace including all the defaults
   xaxis: {/* */},   // ref to x-axis object (i.e layout.xaxis) associated with the selected point
   yaxis: {/* */}    // ref to y-axis object " "
  }, {
    /* similarly for other selected points */
  }]
