{
  points: [{
    curveNumber: 2,  // index in data of the trace associated with the selected point
    pointNumber: 2,  // index of the selected point
    x: 5,        // x value
    y: 600,      // y value
    z: 12,       // z value
    data: {/* */},       // ref to the trace as sent to Plotly.plot associated with the selected point
    fullData: {/* */},   // ref to the trace including all of the default attributes
   xaxis: {/* */},   // ref to x-axis object (i.e layout.xaxis) associated with the selected point
   yaxis: {/* */}    // ref to y-axis object " "
