  points: [{
    curveNumber: 2,  // index in data of the trace associated with the selected point
    pointNumber: 2,  // index of the selected point
    x: 5,        // x value
    y: 600,      // y value
    z: 12,       // z value

    fullData: {/* */},   // ref to the trace including all the defaults
   xaxis: {/* */},   // ref to x-axis object (i.e layout.xaxis) associated with the selected point
