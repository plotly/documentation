  Plotly graphs emit events prefixed with plotly_ when interacted with. Event handlers can be bound to events using the `.on` method that is exposed by the plot div object.
  Please note: it is possible to use jQuery events, but plotly.js no longer bundles jQuery, so we recommend using the plotly.js implementation.

graphDiv.on('plotly_click', function(data){
    	// do something using the event data
	});
