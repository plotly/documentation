<h3>Preset Colourscale</h3>

<p><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html">&quot;Viridis&quot; colourscales</a> are designed to still be perceptible in black-and-white, as well as for those with colourblindness. It comes with five colourscales, selected using the option= parameter: &quot;magma&quot; (or &quot;A&quot;), &quot;inferno&quot; (or &quot;B&quot;), &quot;plasma&quot; (or &quot;C&quot;), &quot;viridis&quot; (or &quot;D&quot;, the default), and &quot;cividis&quot; (or &quot;E&quot;).</p>
