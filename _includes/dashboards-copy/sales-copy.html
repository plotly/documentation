    Client reporting at Likeable Advertising was always a very manual process. 
    The team had to download data from our Ad Serving Platform, import it into 
    Excel, and run custom VBA macros to generate each individual Excel report, 
    which would then be emailed to the client every few days. When we found Plot.ly, 
    we were able to completely revamp our reporting process. Using Python, Plotly and Pandas, 
    we created a brand new reporting portal where clients could view up-to-date campaign 
    performance data in beautifully designed, custom dashboards. We were finally able to 
    provide the real-time visibility our clients were asking for without wasting our team's 
    precious time manually generating hundreds of Excel reports each week.

    Basemap library. With 16 geographic projections, vector rendering, and a streaming API, Plotly maps are used in mission 
    critical applications for call centers, satellite trajectories, product tracking, the social sciences, weather forecasting,
    and online journalism.
