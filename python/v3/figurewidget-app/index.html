 |          that may be specified as:
 |            - An instance of plotly.graph_objs.Layout
 |            - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
 |              to the Layout constructor
 |
 |              Supported dict properties:
 |
 |                  angularaxis
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.AngularAxis instance
 |                      or dict with compatible properties
 |                  annotations
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Annotation instance or
 |                      dict with compatible properties
 |                  annotationdefaults
 |                      When used in a template (as
 |                      layout.template.layout.annotationdefaults),
 |                      sets the default property values to use for
 |                      elements of layout.annotations
 |                  autosize
 |                      Determines whether or not a layout width or
 |                      height that has been left undefined by the user
 |                      is initialized on each relayout. Note that,
 |                      regardless of this attribute, an undefined
 |                      layout width or height is always initialized on
 |                      the first call to plot.
 |                  bargap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
 |                      adjacent location coordinates.
 |                  bargroupgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
 |                      the same location coordinate.
 |                  barmode
 |                      Determines how bars at the same location
 |                      coordinate are displayed on the graph. With
 |                      &#34;stack&#34;, the bars are stacked on top of one
 |                      another With &#34;relative&#34;, the bars are stacked
 |                      on top of one another, with negative values
 |                      below the axis, positive values above With
 |                      &#34;group&#34;, the bars are plotted next to one
 |                      another centered around the shared location.
 |                      With &#34;overlay&#34;, the bars are plotted over one
 |                      another, you might need to an &#34;opacity&#34; to see
 |                      multiple bars.
 |                  barnorm
 |                      Sets the normalization for bar traces on the
 |                      graph. With &#34;fraction&#34;, the value of each bar
 |                      is divided by the sum of all values at that
 |                      location coordinate. &#34;percent&#34; is the same but
 |                      multiplied by 100 to show percentages.
 |                  boxgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes
 |                      of adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect
 |                      on traces that have &#34;width&#34; set.
 |                  boxgroupgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes
 |                      of the same location coordinate. Has no effect
 |                      on traces that have &#34;width&#34; set.
 |                  boxmode
 |                      Determines how boxes at the same location
 |                      coordinate are displayed on the graph. If
 |                      &#34;group&#34;, the boxes are plotted next to one
 |                      another centered around the shared location. If
 |                      &#34;overlay&#34;, the boxes are plotted over one
 |                      another, you might need to set &#34;opacity&#34; to see
 |                      them multiple boxes. Has no effect on traces
 |                      that have &#34;width&#34; set.
 |                  calendar
 |                      Sets the default calendar system to use for
 |                      interpreting and displaying dates throughout
 |                      the plot.
 |                  clickmode
 |                      Determines the mode of single click
 |                      interactions. &#34;event&#34; is the default value and
 |                      emits the `plotly_click` event. In addition
 |                      this mode emits the `plotly_selected` event in
 |                      drag modes &#34;lasso&#34; and &#34;select&#34;, but with no
 |                      event data attached (kept for compatibility
 |                      reasons). The &#34;select&#34; flag enables selecting
 |                      single data points via click. This mode also
 |                      supports persistent selections, meaning that
 |                      pressing Shift while clicking, adds to /
 |                      subtracts from an existing selection. &#34;select&#34;
 |                      with `hovermode`: &#34;x&#34; can be confusing,
 |                      consider explicitly setting `hovermode`:
 |                      &#34;closest&#34; when using this feature. Selection
 |                      events are sent accordingly as long as &#34;event&#34;
 |                      flag is set as well. When the &#34;event&#34; flag is
 |                      missing, `plotly_click` and `plotly_selected`
 |                      events are not fired.
 |                  colorscale
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Colorscale instance or
 |                      dict with compatible properties
 |                  colorway
 |                      Sets the default trace colors.
 |                  datarevision
 |                      If provided, a changed value tells
 |                      `Plotly.react` that one or more data arrays has
 |                      changed. This way you can modify arrays in-
 |                      place rather than making a complete new copy
 |                      for an incremental change. If NOT provided,
 |                      `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are
 |                      being treated as immutable, thus any data array
 |                      with a different identity from its predecessor
 |                      contains new data.
 |                  direction
 |                      Legacy polar charts are deprecated! Please
 |                      switch to &#34;polar&#34; subplots. Sets the direction
 |                      corresponding to positive angles in legacy
 |                      polar charts.
 |                  dragmode
 |                      Determines the mode of drag interactions.
 |                      &#34;select&#34; and &#34;lasso&#34; apply only to scatter
 |                      traces with markers or text. &#34;orbit&#34; and
 |                      &#34;turntable&#34; apply only to 3D scenes.
 |                  editrevision
 |                      Controls persistence of user-driven changes in
 |                      `editable: true` configuration, other than
 |                      trace names and axis titles. Defaults to
 |                      `layout.uirevision`.
 |                  extendpiecolors
 |                      If `true`, the pie slice colors (whether given
 |                      by `piecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`)
 |                      will be extended to three times its original
 |                      length by first repeating every color 20%
 |                      lighter then each color 20% darker. This is
 |                      intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing
 |                      the same color when you have many slices, but
 |                      you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided
 |                      in the trace, using `marker.colors`, are never
 |                      extended.
 |                  font
 |                      Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in
 |                      traces and other layout components inherit from
 |                      the global font.
 |                  geo
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Geo instance or dict
 |                      with compatible properties
 |                  grid
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Grid instance or dict
 |                      with compatible properties
 |                  height
 |                      Sets the plot&#39;s height (in px).
 |                  hiddenlabels
 |
 |                  hiddenlabelssrc
 |                      Sets the source reference on plot.ly for
 |                      hiddenlabels .
 |                  hidesources
 |                      Determines whether or not a text link citing
 |                      the data source is placed at the bottom-right
 |                      cored of the figure. Has only an effect only on
 |                      graphs that have been generated via forked
 |                      graphs from the plotly service (at
 |                      https://plotly.com or on-premise).
 |                  hoverdistance
 |                      Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look
 |                      for data to add hover labels (-1 means no
 |                      cutoff, 0 means no looking for data). This is
 |                      only a real distance for hovering on point-like
 |                      objects, like scatter points. For area-like
 |                      objects (bars, scatter fills, etc) hovering is
 |                      on inside the area and off outside, but these
 |                      objects will not supersede hover on point-like
 |                      objects in case of conflict.

 |                  hovermode
 |                      Determines the mode of hover interactions. If
 |                      `clickmode` includes the &#34;select&#34; flag,
 |                      `hovermode` defaults to &#34;closest&#34;. If
 |                      `clickmode` lacks the &#34;select&#34; flag, it
 |                      defaults to &#34;x&#34; or &#34;y&#34; (depending on the
 |                      trace&#39;s `orientation` value) for plots based on
 |                      cartesian coordinates. For anything else the
 |                      default value is &#34;closest&#34;.

 |                  meta
 |                      Assigns extra meta information that can be used
 |                      in various `text` attributes. Attributes such
 |                      as the graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`
 |                      and annotation `text` support `meta`. One can
 |                      access `meta` fields using template strings:
 |                      `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index of the
 |                      `meta` item in question.
 |                  metasrc
 |                      Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta

 |                  piecolorway
 |                      Sets the default pie slice colors. Defaults to
 |                      the main `colorway` used for trace colors. If
 |                      you specify a new list here it can still be
 |                      extended with lighter and darker colors, see

 |                  separators
 |                      Sets the decimal and thousand separators. For
 |                      example, *. * puts a &#39;.&#39; before decimals and a
 |                      space between thousands. In English locales,
 |                      dflt is &#34;.,&#34; but other locales may alter this

 |                  showlegend
 |                      Determines whether or not a legend is drawn.
 |                      Default is `true` if there is a trace to show
 |                      and any of these: a) Two or more traces would
 |                      by default be shown in the legend. b) One pie
 |                      trace is shown in the legend. c) One trace is
 |                      explicitly given with `showlegend: true`.
 |                  sliders
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Slider instance or
 |                      dict with compatible properties
 |                  sliderdefaults
 |                      When used in a template (as
 |                      layout.template.layout.sliderdefaults), sets
 |                      the default property values to use for elements
 |                      of layout.sliders
 |                  spikedistance
 |                      Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look
 |                      for data to draw spikelines to (-1 means no
 |                      cutoff, 0 means no looking for data). As with
 |                      hoverdistance, distance does not apply to area-
 |                      like objects. In addition, some objects can be
 |                      hovered on but will not generate spikelines,
 |                      such as scatter fills.
 |                  template
 |                      Default attributes to be applied to the plot.
 |                      This should be a dict with format: `{&#39;layout&#39;:
 |                      layoutTemplate, &#39;data&#39;: {trace_type:
 |                      [traceTemplate, ...], ...}}` where
 |                      `layoutTemplate` is a dict matching the
 |                      structure of `figure.layout` and
 |                      `traceTemplate` is a dict matching the
 |                      structure of the trace with type `trace_type`
 |                      (e.g. &#39;scatter&#39;). Alternatively, this may be
 |                      specified as an instance of
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace
 |                      templates are applied cyclically to traces of
 |                      each type. Container arrays (eg `annotations`)
 |                      have special handling: An object ending in
 |                      `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`) is applied
 |                      to each array item. But if an item has a
 |                      `templateitemname` key we look in the template
 |                      array for an item with matching `name` and
 |                      apply that instead. If no matching `name` is
 |                      found we mark the item invisible. Any named
 |                      template item not referenced is appended to the
 |                      end of the array, so this can be used to add a
 |                      watermark annotation or a logo image, for
 |                      example. To omit one of these items on the
 |                      plot, make an item with matching
 |                      `templateitemname` and `visible: false`.

 |                  title
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Title instance or dict
 |                      with compatible properties
 |                  titlefont
 |                      Deprecated: Please use layout.title.font
 |                      instead. Sets the title font. Note that the
 |                      title&#39;s font used to be customized by the now
 |                      deprecated `titlefont` attribute.
 |                  transition
 |                      Sets transition options used during
 |                      Plotly.react updates.
 |                  uirevision
 |                      Used to allow user interactions with the plot
 |                      to persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are
 |                      unaware of these interactions. If `uirevision`
 |                      is omitted, or if it is given and it changed
 |                      from the previous `Plotly.react` call, the
 |                      exact new figure is used. If `uirevision` is
 |                      truthy and did NOT change, any attribute that
 |                      has been affected by user interactions and did
 |                      not receive a different value in the new figure
 |                      will keep the interaction value.
 |                      `layout.uirevision` attribute serves as the
 |                      default for `uirevision` attributes in various
 |                      sub-containers. For finer control you can set
 |                      these sub-attributes directly. For example, if
 |                      your app separately controls the data on the x
 |                      and y axes you might set
 |                      `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and
 |                      `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y
 |                      data is changed, you can update
 |                      `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*` and the y axis
 |                      range will reset but the x axis range will
 |                      retain any user-driven zoom.

 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Updatemenu instance or
 |                      dict with compatible properties
 |                  updatemenudefaults
 |                      When used in a template (as
 |                      layout.template.layout.updatemenudefaults),
 |                      sets the default property values to use for

 |                  violingap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins
 |                      of adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect

 |                  violingroupgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins

 |                  violinmode
 |                      Determines how violins at the same location
 |                      coordinate are displayed on the graph. If
 |                      &#34;group&#34;, the violins are plotted next to one
 |                      another centered around the shared location. If
 |                      &#34;overlay&#34;, the violins are plotted over one
 |                      another, you might need to set &#34;opacity&#34; to see

 |      frames
 |          The &#39;frames&#39; property is a tuple of instances of
 |          Frame that may be specified as:
 |            - A list or tuple of instances of plotly.graph_objs.Frame
 |            - A list or tuple of dicts of string/value properties that

 |              Supported dict properties:
 |
 |                  baseframe
 |                      The name of the frame into which this frame&#39;s
 |                      properties are merged before applying. This is
 |                      used to unify properties and avoid needing to
 |                      specify the same values for the same properties
 |                      in multiple frames.
 |                  data
 |                      A list of traces this frame modifies. The
 |                      format is identical to the normal trace
 |                      definition.
 |                  group
 |                      An identifier that specifies the group to which
 |                      the frame belongs, used by animate to select a
 |                      subset of frames.

 |                  traces
 |                      A list of trace indices that identify the
 |                      respective traces in the data attribute
 |
 |      skip_invalid: bool
 |          If True, invalid properties in the figure specification will be

 |
 |      Raises
 |      ------
 |      ValueError
 |          if a property in the specification of data, layout, or frames
 |          is invalid AND skip_invalid is False

 |  add_area(self, customdata=None, customdatasrc=None, hoverinfo=None, hoverinfosrc=None, hoverlabel=None, ids=None, idssrc=None, legendgroup=None, marker=None, name=None, opacity=None, r=None, rsrc=None, selectedpoints=None, showlegend=None, stream=None, t=None, tsrc=None, uid=None, uirevision=None, visible=None, row=None, col=None, **kwargs)
 |      Add a new Area trace
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.area.Hoverlabel instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      marker
 |          plotly.graph_objs.area.Marker instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      r
 |          Area traces are deprecated! Please switch to the
 |          &#34;barpolar&#34; trace type. Sets the radial coordinates for
 |          legacy polar chart only.
 |      rsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.area.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      t
 |          Area traces are deprecated! Please switch to the
 |          &#34;barpolar&#34; trace type. Sets the angular coordinates for
 |          legacy polar chart only.
 |      tsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  t .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`

 |      Add a new Bar trace
 |
 |      The data visualized by the span of the bars is set in `y` if
 |      `orientation` is set th &#34;v&#34; (the default) and the labels are
 |      set in `x`. By setting `orientation` to &#34;h&#34;, the roles are
 |      interchanged.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      base
 |          Sets where the bar base is drawn (in position axis
 |          units). In &#34;stack&#34; or &#34;relative&#34; barmode, traces that
 |          set &#34;base&#34; will be excluded and drawn in &#34;overlay&#34; mode
 |          instead.
 |      basesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  base .
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the
 |          subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines
 |          and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
 |          `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
 |      constraintext
 |          Constrain the size of text inside or outside a bar to
 |          be no larger than the bar itself.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.bar.Hoverlabel instance or dict with

 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example

 |          described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example

 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object

 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text`.
 |      textposition
 |          Specifies the location of the `text`. &#34;inside&#34;
 |          positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
 |          and scaled if needed). &#34;outside&#34; positions `text`
 |          outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
 |          there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
 |          gets pushed inside. &#34;auto&#34; tries to position `text`
 |          inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
 |          is stacked on this one the text is moved outside.

 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

 |      Add a new Box trace
 |
 |      In vertical (horizontal) box plots, statistics are computed
 |      using `y` (`x`) values. By supplying an `x` (`y`) array, one
 |      box per distinct x (y) value is drawn If no `x` (`y`) list is
 |      provided, a single box is drawn. That box position is then
 |      positioned with with `name` or with `x0` (`y0`) if provided.
 |      Each box spans from quartile 1 (Q1) to quartile 3 (Q3). The
 |      second quartile (Q2) is marked by a line inside the box. By
 |      default, the whiskers correspond to the box&#39; edges +/- 1.5
 |      times the interquartile range (IQR = Q3-Q1), see &#34;boxpoints&#34;
 |      for other options.

 |      boxpoints
 |          If &#34;outliers&#34;, only the sample points lying outside the
 |          whiskers are shown If &#34;suspectedoutliers&#34;, the outlier
 |          points are shown and points either less than 4*Q1-3*Q3
 |          or greater than 4*Q3-3*Q1 are highlighted (see
 |          `outliercolor`) If &#34;all&#34;, all sample points are shown
 |          If False, only the box(es) are shown with no sample
 |          points
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note

 |      pointpos
 |          Sets the position of the sample points in relation to
 |          the box(es). If 0, the sample points are places over
 |          the center of the box(es). Positive (negative) values

 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid

 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |          plotly.graph_objs.box.Unselected instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      whiskerwidth
 |          Sets the width of the whiskers relative to the box&#39;
 |          width. For example, with 1, the whiskers are as wide as
 |          the box(es).
 |      width
 |          Sets the width of the box in data coordinate If 0
 |          (default value) the width is automatically selected
 |          based on the positions of other box traces in the same
 |          subplot.

 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.carpet.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          A two dimensional array of x coordinates at each carpet
 |          point. If ommitted, the plot is a cheater plot and the
 |          xaxis is hidden by default.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      y
 |          A two dimensional array of y coordinates at each carpet
 |          point.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the

 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using

 |          `layout.geo`. If &#34;geo2&#34;, the geospatial coordinates
 |          refer to `layout.geo2`, and so on.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed

 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must
 |          be set as well.

 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.cone.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with the cones. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      u
 |          Sets the x components of the vector field.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |      Add a new Contour trace
 |
 |      The data from which contour lines are computed is set in `z`.
 |      Data in `z` must be a 2D list of numbers. Say that `z` has N
 |      rows and M columns, then by default, these N rows correspond to
 |      N y coordinates (set in `y` or auto-generated) and the M
 |      columns correspond to M x coordinates (set in `x` or auto-
 |      generated). By setting `transpose` to True, the above behavior
 |      is flipped.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      autocontour
 |          Determines whether or not the contour level attributes
 |          are picked by an algorithm. If True, the number of
 |          contour levels can be set in `ncontours`. If False, set
 |          the contour level attributes in `contours`.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.contour.ColorBar instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H

 |          with compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

 |      dy
 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color if `contours.type` is &#34;constraint&#34;.
 |          Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line
 |          color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is
 |          available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel

 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup

 |      ncontours
 |          Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual
 |          number of contours will be chosen automatically to be
 |          less than or equal to the value of `ncontours`. Has an
 |          effect only if `autocontour` is True or if
 |          `contours.size` is missing.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for

 |      transpose
 |          Transposes the z data.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

 |          color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is
 |          available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      ncontours
 |          Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual
 |          number of contours will be chosen automatically to be
 |          less than or equal to the value of `ncontours`. Has an
 |          effect only if `autocontour` is True or if
 |          `contours.size` is missing.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.contourcarpet.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each z value.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      transpose
 |          Transposes the z data.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and

 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      z
 |          Sets the z data.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  z .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using

 |      Add a new Heatmap trace
 |
 |      The data that describes the heatmap value-to-color mapping is
 |      set in `z`. Data in `z` can either be a 2D list of values
 |      (ragged or not) or a 1D array of values. In the case where `z`
 |      is a 2D list, say that `z` has N rows and M columns. Then, by
 |      default, the resulting heatmap will have N partitions along the
 |      y axis and M partitions along the x axis. In other words, the
 |      i-th row/ j-th column cell in `z` is mapped to the i-th
 |      partition of the y axis (starting from the bottom of the plot)
 |      and the j-th partition of the x-axis (starting from the left of
 |      the plot). This behavior can be flipped by using `transpose`.
 |      Moreover, `x` (`y`) can be provided with M or M+1 (N or N+1)
 |      elements. If M (N), then the coordinates correspond to the
 |      center of the heatmap cells and the cells have equal width. If
 |      M+1 (N+1), then the coordinates correspond to the edges of the
 |      heatmap cells. In the case where `z` is a 1D list, the x and y
 |      coordinates must be provided in `x` and `y` respectively to
 |      form data triplets.

 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is

 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the

 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      ytype
 |          If &#34;array&#34;, the heatmap&#39;s y coordinates are given by
 |          &#34;y&#34; (the default behavior when `y` is provided) If

 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  z .

 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autobinx
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autobiny
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`
 |          from the trace.
 |      cumulative

 |          with compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements

 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      error_x
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram.ErrorX instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      error_y
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram.ErrorY instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      histfunc
 |          Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
 |          trace. If &#34;count&#34;, the histogram values are computed by
 |          counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
 |          &#34;sum&#34;, &#34;avg&#34;, &#34;min&#34;, &#34;max&#34;, the histogram values are
 |          computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
 |          maximum of the values lying inside each bin
 |          respectively.
 |      histnorm
 |          Specifies the type of normalization used for this
 |          histogram trace. If &#34;&#34;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
 |          number of data points lying inside the bins). If
 |          &#34;percent&#34; / &#34;probability&#34;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
 |          with respect to the total number of sample points
 |          (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
 |          &#34;density&#34;, the span of each bar corresponds to the
 |          number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
 |          the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
 |          the total number of sample points). If *probability
 |          density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
 |          probability that an event will fall into the
 |          corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
 |          equals 1).
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the

 |      nbinsx
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `xbins.size` is provided.
 |      nbinsy
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This

 |          with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.

 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by

 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |      `x` and `y` (where `x` and `y` represent marginal
 |      distributions, binning is set in `xbins` and `ybins` in this
 |      case) or `z` (where `z` represent the 2D distribution and
 |      binning set, binning is set by `x` and `y` in this case). The
 |      resulting distribution is visualized as a heatmap.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autobinx
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autobiny
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2d.ColorBar instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      histfunc
 |          Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
 |          trace. If &#34;count&#34;, the histogram values are computed by
 |          counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
 |          &#34;sum&#34;, &#34;avg&#34;, &#34;min&#34;, &#34;max&#34;, the histogram values are
 |          computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
 |          maximum of the values lying inside each bin
 |          respectively.
 |      histnorm
 |          Specifies the type of normalization used for this
 |          histogram trace. If &#34;&#34;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
 |          number of data points lying inside the bins). If
 |          &#34;percent&#34; / &#34;probability&#34;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
 |          with respect to the total number of sample points
 |          (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
 |          &#34;density&#34;, the span of each bar corresponds to the
 |          number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
 |          the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
 |          the total number of sample points). If *probability
 |          density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
 |          probability that an event will fall into the
 |          corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
 |          equals 1).
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `xbins.size` is provided.
 |      nbinsy
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `ybins.size` is provided.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2d.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ybins
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2d.YBins instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties

 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will

 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will

 |          from the trace.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by

 |          Determines whether or not the contour level attributes
 |          are picked by an algorithm. If True, the number of

 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.ColorBar instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the

 |          respectively.
 |      histnorm
 |          Specifies the type of normalization used for this

 |          equals 1).
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ybins
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.YBins instance or

 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend

 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and

 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |          Sets the 4th dimension (value) of the vertices.
 |      valuesrc

 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |      Add a new Mesh3d trace
 |
 |      Draws sets of triangles with coordinates given by three
 |      1-dimensional arrays in `x`, `y`, `z` and (1) a sets of `i`,
 |      `j`, `k` indices (2) Delaunay triangulation or (3) the Alpha-
 |      shape algorithm or (4) the Convex-hull algorithm
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      alphahull
 |          Determines how the mesh surface triangles are derived
 |          from the set of vertices (points) represented by the
 |          `x`, `y` and `z` arrays, if the `i`, `j`, `k` arrays
 |          are not supplied. For general use of `mesh3d` it is
 |          preferred that `i`, `j`, `k` are supplied. If &#34;-1&#34;,
 |          Delaunay triangulation is used, which is mainly
 |          suitable if the mesh is a single, more or less layer
 |          surface that is perpendicular to `delaunayaxis`. In
 |          case the `delaunayaxis` intersects the mesh surface at
 |          more than one point it will result triangles that are
 |          very long in the dimension of `delaunayaxis`. If &#34;&gt;0&#34;,
 |          the alpha-shape algorithm is used. In this case, the
 |          positive `alphahull` value signals the use of the
 |          alpha-shape algorithm, _and_ its value acts as the
 |          parameter for the mesh fitting. If 0,  the convex-hull
 |          algorithm is used. It is suitable for convex bodies or
 |          if the intention is to enclose the `x`, `y` and `z`
 |          point set into a convex hull.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here `intensity`) or
 |          the bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to
 |          `false` when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `intensity` and if set, `cmin`
 |          must be set as well.
 |      cmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `intensity` and if set, `cmax`
 |          must be set as well.
 |      color
 |          Sets the color of the whole mesh
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.mesh3d.ColorBar instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H

 |          Sets the Delaunay axis, which is the axis that is
 |          perpendicular to the surface of the Delaunay
 |          triangulation. It has an effect if `i`, `j`, `k` are
 |          not provided and `alphahull` is set to indicate
 |          Delaunay triangulation.
 |      facecolor
 |          Sets the color of each face Overrides &#34;color&#34; and
 |          &#34;vertexcolor&#34;.
 |      facecolorsrc

 |          poly look via flat reflections.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed

 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.

 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xbounds
 |          Specify `xbounds` in the shape of `[xMin, xMax] to
 |          avoid looping through the `xy` typed array. Use it in
 |          conjunction with `xy` and `ybounds` for the performance
 |          benefits.
 |      xboundssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  xbounds .
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      xy
 |          Faster alternative to specifying `x` and `y`
 |          separately. If supplied, it must be a typed
 |          `Float32Array` array that represents points such that
 |          `xy[i * 2] = x[i]` and `xy[i * 2 + 1] = y[i]`
 |      xysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  xy .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ybounds
 |          Specify `ybounds` in the shape of `[yMin, yMax] to
 |          avoid looping through the `xy` typed array. Use it in
 |          conjunction with `xy` and `xbounds` for the performance
 |          benefits.
 |      yboundssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ybounds .
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using

 |      Add a new Sankey trace
 |
 |      Sankey plots for network flow data analysis. The nodes are
 |      specified in `nodes` and the links between sources and targets
 |      in `links`. The colors are set in `nodes[i].color` and
 |      `links[i].color`; otherwise defaults are used.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      arrangement
 |          If value is `snap` (the default), the node arrangement
 |          is assisted by automatic snapping of elements to
 |          preserve space between nodes specified via `nodepad`.
 |          If value is `perpendicular`, the nodes can only move
 |          along a line perpendicular to the flow. If value is
 |          `freeform`, the nodes can freely move on the plane. If
 |          value is `fixed`, the nodes are stationary.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      domain

 |          compatible properties
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If

 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired. Note that this attribute is
 |          superseded by `node.hoverinfo` and `node.hoverinfo` for
 |          nodes and links respectively.
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.sankey.Hoverlabel instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      link
 |          The links of the Sankey plot.

 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.sankey.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font for node labels
 |      uid

 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |      valueformat
 |          Sets the value formatting rule using d3 formatting
 |          mini-language which is similar to those of Python. See
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#l
 |          ocale_format
 |      valuesuffix

 |          Add a space if a separation is necessary from the
 |          value.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using

 |      Add a new Scatter trace
 |
 |      The scatter trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts,
 |      text charts, and bubble charts. The data visualized as scatter
 |      point or lines is set in `x` and `y`. Text (appearing either on
 |      the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble charts are
 |      achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to
 |      numerical arrays.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      dx
 |          Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
 |      dy
 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      error_x
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.ErrorX instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      error_y
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.ErrorY instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
 |          &#34;none&#34; unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;) if `orientation` is &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;) Use
 |          with `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;
 |          fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. &#34;tonextx&#34; and
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; fill between the endpoints of this trace and
 |          the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;. &#34;toself&#34; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it. &#34;tonext&#34;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
 |          be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
 |          multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
 |          not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
 |          the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
 |          order.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      groupnorm
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of
 |          this `stackgroup`. With &#34;fraction&#34;, the value of each
 |          trace at each location is divided by the sum of all
 |          trace values at that location. &#34;percent&#34; is the same
 |          but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are
 |          multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one
 |          subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Hoverlabel instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is &#34;toself&#34; or &#34;tonext&#34; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &#34;fills&#34;,
 |          otherwise it is &#34;points&#34;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      line
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Line instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      marker
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Marker instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &#34;lines+markers&#34;. Otherwise, &#34;lines&#34;.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With &#34;v&#34;
 |          (&#34;h&#34;), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.
 |          Also affects the default value of `fill`.
 |      r
 |          r coordinates in scatter traces are deprecated!Please
 |          switch to the &#34;scatterpolar&#34; trace type.Sets the radial
 |          coordinatesfor legacy polar chart only.
 |      rsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .
 |      selected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Selected instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stackgaps
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at
 |          which other traces in this group have data but this one
 |          does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these
 |          locations. With &#34;interpolate&#34; we linearly interpolate
 |          between existing values, and extrapolate a constant
 |          beyond the existing values.
 |      stackgroup
 |          Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the
 |          same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or
 |          their x values if `orientation` is &#34;h&#34;). If blank or
 |          omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also
 |          turns `fill` on by default, using &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;)
 |          if `orientation` is &#34;h&#34; (&#34;v&#34;) and sets the default
 |          `mode` to &#34;lines&#34; irrespective of point count. You can
 |          only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in
 |          a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)
 |          other traces in the same group. With multiple
 |          `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if
 |          fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the
 |          later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties

 |          switch to the &#34;scatterpolar&#34; trace type.Sets the
 |          angular coordinatesfor legacy polar chart only.
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .

 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |          coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the

 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be

 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed

 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      selected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattercarpet.Selected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattercarpet.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (a,b,c) point.
 |          If a single string, the same string appears over all
 |          the data points. If an array of strings, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b,c).
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattercarpet.Unselected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be

 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing

 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      dx
 |          Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.

 |      error_y
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattergl.ErrorY instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
 |          &#34;none&#34; unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;) if `orientation` is &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;) Use
 |          with `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;
 |          fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. &#34;tonextx&#34; and
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; fill between the endpoints of this trace and
 |          the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;. &#34;toself&#34; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if

 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
 |          be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
 |          multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
 |          not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
 |          the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
 |          order.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattergl.Hoverlabel instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the

 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids

 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream

 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.

 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still

 |      Add a new Scatterpolar trace
 |
 |      The scatterpolar trace type encompasses line charts, scatter
 |      charts, text charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates.
 |      The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `r`
 |      (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Text (appearing

 |      charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or
 |      `marker.color` to numerical arrays.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      dr
 |          Sets the r coordinate step.
 |      dtheta
 |          Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the
 |          `dtheta` step equals the subplot&#39;s period divided by
 |          the length of the `r` coordinates.
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with
 |          `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. scatterpolar has a subset of
 |          the options available to scatter. &#34;toself&#34; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it. &#34;tonext&#34;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolar.Hoverlabel instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is &#34;toself&#34; or &#34;tonext&#34; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &#34;fills&#34;,
 |          otherwise it is &#34;points&#34;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the

 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object

 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolar.Marker instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &#34;lines+markers&#34;. Otherwise, &#34;lines&#34;.

 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      r
 |          Sets the radial coordinates
 |      r0
 |          Alternate to `r`. Builds a linear space of r
 |          coordinates. Use with `dr` where `r0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dr` the step.

 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolar.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      subplot
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s data coordinates
 |          and a polar subplot. If &#34;polar&#34; (the default value),
 |          the data refer to `layout.polar`. If &#34;polar2&#34;, the data
 |          refer to `layout.polar2`, and so on.
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      theta
 |          Sets the angular coordinates
 |      theta0
 |          Alternate to `theta`. Builds a linear space of theta
 |          coordinates. Use with `dtheta` where `theta0` is the
 |          starting coordinate and `dtheta` the step.
 |      thetasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  theta .
 |      thetaunit
 |          Sets the unit of input &#34;theta&#34; values. Has an effect
 |          only when on &#34;linear&#34; angular axes.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolar.Unselected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`

 |      Add a new Scatterpolargl trace
 |
 |      The scatterpolargl trace type encompasses line charts, scatter
 |      charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates using the WebGL
 |      plotting engine. The data visualized as scatter point or lines
 |      is set in `r` (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Bubble
 |      charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or
 |      `marker.color` to numerical arrays.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      dr
 |          Sets the r coordinate step.
 |      dtheta
 |          Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the
 |          `dtheta` step equals the subplot&#39;s period divided by
 |          the length of the `r` coordinates.
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
 |          &#34;none&#34; unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;) if `orientation` is &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;) Use
 |          with `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;
 |          fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. &#34;tonextx&#34; and
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; fill between the endpoints of this trace and
 |          the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;. &#34;toself&#34; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it. &#34;tonext&#34;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
 |          be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
 |          multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
 |          not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
 |          the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
 |          order.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolargl.Hoverlabel instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.

 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &#34;lines+markers&#34;. Otherwise, &#34;lines&#34;.

 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolargl.Stream instance or

 |          refer to `layout.polar2`, and so on.
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects

 |          Sets the angular coordinates
 |      theta0
 |          Alternate to `theta`. Builds a linear space of theta
 |          coordinates. Use with `dtheta` where `theta0` is the
 |          starting coordinate and `dtheta` the step.
 |      thetasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  theta .
 |      thetaunit
 |          Sets the unit of input &#34;theta&#34; values. Has an effect
 |          only when on &#34;linear&#34; angular axes.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is

 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolargl.Unselected instance or

 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`

 |          If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all provided, they need not be
 |          normalized, only the relative values matter. If only
 |          two arrays are provided they must be normalized to
 |          match `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum`.
 |      bsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  b .
 |      c
 |          Sets the quantity of component `a` in each data point.
 |          If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all provided, they need not be
 |          normalized, only the relative values matter. If only
 |          two arrays are provided they must be normalized to
 |          match `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum`.
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      csrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  c .
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with
 |          `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. scatterternary has a subset
 |          of the options available to scatter. &#34;toself&#34; connects
 |          the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the
 |          trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34;
 |          fills the space between two traces if one completely
 |          encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and
 |          behaves like &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it.
 |          &#34;tonext&#34; should not be used if one trace does not
 |          enclose the other.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is &#34;toself&#34; or &#34;tonext&#34; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &#34;fills&#34;,
 |          otherwise it is &#34;points&#34;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (a,b,c)
 |          point. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of strings, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b,c).
 |          To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a &#34;text&#34;
 |          flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup

 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterternary.Marker instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &#34;lines+markers&#34;. Otherwise, &#34;lines&#34;.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.

 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterternary.Stream instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      subplot
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s data coordinates
 |          and a ternary subplot. If &#34;ternary&#34; (the default
 |          value), the data refer to `layout.ternary`. If
 |          &#34;ternary2&#34;, the data refer to `layout.ternary2`, and so
 |          on.
 |      sum
 |          The number each triplet should sum to, if only two of
 |          `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided. This overrides
 |          `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum` to normalize this specific trace, but
 |          does not affect the values displayed on the axes. 0 (or
 |          missing) means to use ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (a,b,c) point.
 |          If a single string, the same string appears over all
 |          the data points. If an array of strings, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b,c). If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterternary.Unselected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using

 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed

 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

 |      text
 |          Sets a text element associated with this trace. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag, this text
 |          element will be seen in all hover labels. Note that
 |          streamtube traces do not support array `text` values.
 |      u
 |          Sets the x components of the vector field.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.table.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`

 |      Add a new Violin trace
 |
 |      In vertical (horizontal) violin plots, statistics are computed

 |      violin per distinct x (y) value is drawn If no `x` (`y`) list
 |      is provided, a single violin is drawn. That violin position is
 |      then positioned with with `name` or with `x0` (`y0`) if
 |      provided.
 |
 |      Parameters

 |          position axis is categorical
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the violin(s). If &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;),
 |          the distribution is visualized along the vertical
 |          (horizontal).
 |      pointpos
 |          Sets the position of the sample points in relation to
 |          the violins. If 0, the sample points are places over
 |          the center of the violins. Positive (negative) values
 |          correspond to positions to the right (left) for
 |          vertical violins and above (below) for horizontal
 |          violins.
 |      points
 |          If &#34;outliers&#34;, only the sample points lying outside the

 |          or greater than 4*Q3-3*Q1 are highlighted (see
 |          `outliercolor`) If &#34;all&#34;, all sample points are shown
 |          If False, only the violins are shown with no sample
 |          points
 |      scalegroup
 |          If there are multiple violins that should be sized
 |          according to to some metric (see `scalemode`), link
 |          them by providing a non-empty group id here shared by
 |          every trace in the same group.
 |      scalemode
 |          Sets the metric by which the width of each violin is
 |          determined.&#34;width&#34; means each violin has the same (max)
 |          width*count* means the violins are scaled by the number
 |          of sample points makingup each violin.
 |      selected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.violin.Selected instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      side
 |          Determines on which side of the position value the
 |          density function making up one half of a violin is
 |          plotted. Useful when comparing two violin traces under
 |          &#34;overlay&#34; mode, where one trace has `side` set to
 |          &#34;positive&#34; and the other to &#34;negative&#34;.
 |      span
 |          Sets the span in data space for which the density
 |          function will be computed. Has an effect only when
 |          `spanmode` is set to &#34;manual&#34;.
 |      spanmode
 |          Sets the method by which the span in data space where
 |          the density function will be computed. &#34;soft&#34; means the
 |          span goes from the sample&#39;s minimum value minus two
 |          bandwidths to the sample&#39;s maximum value plus two
 |          bandwidths. &#34;hard&#34; means the span goes from the
 |          sample&#39;s minimum to its maximum value. For custom span
 |          settings, use mode &#34;manual&#34; and fill in the `span`
 |          attribute.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.violin.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each sample
 |          value. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |          plotly.graph_objs.violin.Unselected instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      width
 |          Sets the width of the violin in data coordinates. If 0
 |          (default value) the width is automatically selected
 |          based on the positions of other violin traces in the
 |          same subplot.
 |      x
 |          Sets the x sample data or coordinates. See overview for
 |          more info.

 |          Sets the x coordinate of the box. See overview for more
 |          info.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y sample data or coordinates. See overview for

 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      Suppose we have a figure widget, `fig`, with a single trace.
 |
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; import plotly.graph_objs as go
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = go.FigureWidget(data=[{&#39;y&#39;: [3, 4, 2]}])
 |
 |      1) Animate a change in the xaxis and yaxis ranges using default
 |      duration and easing parameters.
 |
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_animate():
 |      ...     fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      ...     fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |
 |      2) Animate a change in the size and color of the trace&#39;s markers
 |      over 2 seconds using the elastic-in-out easing method
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_update(duration=2000, easing=&#39;elastic-in-out&#39;):
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.size = 20
 |
 |  batch_update(self)
 |      A context manager that batches up trace and layout assignment
 |      operations into a singe plotly_update message that is executed when
 |      the context exits.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      For example, suppose we have a figure widget, `fig`, with a single
 |      trace.
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; import plotly.graph_objs as go
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = go.FigureWidget(data=[{&#39;y&#39;: [3, 4, 2]}])
 |
 |      If we want to update the xaxis range, the yaxis range, and the
 |      marker color, we could do so using a series of three property
 |      assignments as follows:
 |
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |
 |      This will work, however it will result in three messages being
 |      sent to the front end (two relayout messages for the axis range
 |      updates followed by one restyle message for the marker color
 |      update). This can cause the plot to appear to stutter as the
 |      three updates are applied incrementally.
 |
 |      We can avoid this problem by performing these three assignments in a
 |      `batch_update` context as follows:
 |
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_update():
 |      ...     fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      ...     fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |
 |      Now, these three property updates will be sent to the frontend in a
 |      single update message, and they will be applied by the front end
 |      simultaneously.
 |
 |  plotly_relayout(self, relayout_data, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a Plotly relayout operation on the figure&#39;s layout
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      relayout_data : dict
 |          Dict of layout updates
 |
 |          dict keys are strings that specify the properties to be updated.
 |          Nested properties are expressed by joining successive keys on
 |          &#39;.&#39; characters (e.g. &#39;xaxis.range&#39;)
 |
 |          dict values are the values to use to update the layout.
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |
 |  plotly_restyle(self, restyle_data, trace_indexes=None, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a Plotly restyle operation on the figure&#39;s traces
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      restyle_data : dict
 |          Dict of trace style updates.
 |
 |          Keys are strings that specify the properties to be updated.
 |          Nested properties are expressed by joining successive keys on
 |          &#39;.&#39; characters (e.g. &#39;marker.color&#39;).
 |
 |          Values may be scalars or lists. When values are scalars,
 |          that scalar value is applied to all traces specified by the
 |          `trace_indexes` parameter.  When values are lists,
 |          the restyle operation will cycle through the elements
 |          of the list as it cycles through the traces specified by the
 |          `trace_indexes` parameter.
 |
 |          Caution: To use plotly_restyle to update a list property (e.g.
 |          the `x` property of the scatter trace), the property value
 |          should be a scalar list containing the list to update with. For
 |          example, the following command would be used to update the &#39;x&#39;
 |          property of the first trace to the list [1, 2, 3]
 |
 |          &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.plotly_restyle({&#39;x&#39;: [[1, 2, 3]]}, 0)
 |
 |      trace_indexes : int or list of int
 |          Trace index, or list of trace indexes, that the restyle operation
 |          applies to. Defaults to all trace indexes.
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |
 |  plotly_update(self, restyle_data=None, relayout_data=None, trace_indexes=None, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a Plotly update operation on the figure.

 |          `plotly_relayout` method for details
 |      trace_indexes :
 |          Trace index, or list of trace indexes, that the update operation
 |          applies to. Defaults to all trace indexes.

 |
 |  hold_trait_notifications(self)

 |
 |      Use this when doing multiple trait assignments (init, config), to avoid

 |      All trait notifications will fire after all values have been assigned.
 |
 |  observe(self, handler, names=traitlets.All, type=&#39;change&#39;)
 |      Setup a handler to be called when a trait changes.
 |
 |      This is used to setup dynamic notifications of trait changes.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      handler : callable
 |          A callable that is called when a trait changes. Its
 |          signature should be ``handler(change)``, where ``change`` is a
 |          dictionary. The change dictionary at least holds a &#39;type&#39; key.
 |          * ``type``: the type of notification.
 |          Other keys may be passed depending on the value of &#39;type&#39;. In the
 |          case where type is &#39;change&#39;, we also have the following keys:
 |          * ``owner`` : the HasTraits instance
 |          * ``old`` : the old value of the modified trait attribute
 |          * ``new`` : the new value of the modified trait attribute
 |          * ``name`` : the name of the modified trait attribute.
 |      names : list, str, All
 |          If names is All, the handler will apply to all traits.  If a list
 |          of str, handler will apply to all names in the list.  If a
 |          str, the handler will apply just to that name.
 |      type : str, All (default: &#39;change&#39;)
 |          The type of notification to filter by. If equal to All, then all
 |          notifications are passed to the observe handler.
 |
 |  on_trait_change(self, handler=None, name=None, remove=False)
 |      DEPRECATED: Setup a handler to be called when a trait changes.
 |
 |      This is used to setup dynamic notifications of trait changes.
 |
 |      Static handlers can be created by creating methods on a HasTraits
 |      subclass with the naming convention &#39;_[traitname]_changed&#39;.  Thus,
 |      to create static handler for the trait &#39;a&#39;, create the method
 |      _a_changed(self, name, old, new) (fewer arguments can be used, see
 |      below).
 |
 |      If `remove` is True and `handler` is not specified, all change
 |      handlers for the specified name are uninstalled.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      handler : callable, None
 |          A callable that is called when a trait changes.  Its
 |          signature can be handler(), handler(name), handler(name, new),
 |          handler(name, old, new), or handler(name, old, new, self).
 |      name : list, str, None
 |          If None, the handler will apply to all traits.  If a list
 |          of str, handler will apply to all names in the list.  If a
 |          str, the handler will apply just to that name.
 |      remove : bool
 |          If False (the default), then install the handler.  If True
 |          then unintall it.
 |
 |  set_trait(self, name, value)
 |      Forcibly sets trait attribute, including read-only attributes.
 |
 |  setup_instance(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      This is called **before** self.__init__ is called.
 |
 |  trait_metadata(self, traitname, key, default=None)
 |      Get metadata values for trait by key.
 |
 |  trait_names(self, **metadata)
 |      Get a list of all the names of this class&#39; traits.
 |
 |  traits(self, **metadata)
 |      Get a ``dict`` of all the traits of this class.  The dictionary
 |      is keyed on the name and the values are the TraitType objects.
 |
 |      The TraitTypes returned don&#39;t know anything about the values
 |      that the various HasTrait&#39;s instances are holding.
 |
 |      The metadata kwargs allow functions to be passed in which
 |      filter traits based on metadata values.  The functions should
 |      take a single value as an argument and return a boolean.  If
 |      any function returns False, then the trait is not included in
 |      the output.  If a metadata key doesn&#39;t exist, None will be passed
 |      to the function.
 |
 |  unobserve(self, handler, names=traitlets.All, type=&#39;change&#39;)
 |      Remove a trait change handler.
 |
 |      This is used to unregister handlers to trait change notifications.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      handler : callable
 |          The callable called when a trait attribute changes.
 |      names : list, str, All (default: All)
 |          The names of the traits for which the specified handler should be
 |          uninstalled. If names is All, the specified handler is uninstalled
 |          from the list of notifiers corresponding to all changes.
 |      type : str or All (default: &#39;change&#39;)
 |          The type of notification to filter by. If All, the specified handler
 |          is uninstalled from the list of notifiers corresponding to all types.
 |
 |  unobserve_all(self, name=traitlets.All)
 |      Remove trait change handlers of any type for the specified name.
 |      If name is not specified, removes all trait notifiers.

 |  Class methods inherited from traitlets.traitlets.HasTraits:
 |
 |  class_own_trait_events(name) from traitlets.traitlets.MetaHasTraits
 |      Get a dict of all event handlers defined on this class, not a parent.
 |
 |      Works like ``event_handlers``, except for excluding traits from parents.
 |
 |  class_own_traits(**metadata) from traitlets.traitlets.MetaHasTraits
 |      Get a dict of all the traitlets defined on this class, not a parent.
 |
 |      Works like `class_traits`, except for excluding traits from parents.
 |
 |  class_trait_names(**metadata) from traitlets.traitlets.MetaHasTraits
 |      Get a list of all the names of this class&#39; traits.
 |
 |      This method is just like the :meth:`trait_names` method,
 |      but is unbound.
 |
 |  class_traits(**metadata) from traitlets.traitlets.MetaHasTraits
 |      Get a ``dict`` of all the traits of this class.  The dictionary
 |      is keyed on the name and the values are the TraitType objects.
 |
 |      This method is just like the :meth:`traits` method, but is unbound.
 |
 |      The TraitTypes returned don&#39;t know anything about the values
 |      that the various HasTrait&#39;s instances are holding.
 |
 |      The metadata kwargs allow functions to be passed in which
 |      filter traits based on metadata values.  The functions should
 |      take a single value as an argument and return a boolean.  If
 |      any function returns False, then the trait is not included in
 |      the output.  If a metadata key doesn&#39;t exist, None will be passed
 |      to the function.
 |
 |  trait_events(name=None) from traitlets.traitlets.MetaHasTraits
 |      Get a ``dict`` of all the event handlers of this class.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      name: str (default: None)
 |          The name of a trait of this class. If name is ``None`` then all
 |          the event handlers of this class will be returned instead.
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      The event handlers associated with a trait name, or all event handlers.
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data descriptors inherited from traitlets.traitlets.HasTraits:
 |
 |  cross_validation_lock
 |      A contextmanager for running a block with our cross validation lock set
 |      to True.
 |
 |      At the end of the block, the lock&#39;s value is restored to its value
 |      prior to entering the block.
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Static methods inherited from traitlets.traitlets.HasDescriptors:
 |
 |  __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Create and return a new object.  See help(type) for accurate signature.
