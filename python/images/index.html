We recommend you read our <a href="/python/getting-started/">Getting Started guide</a> for the latest installation or upgrade instructions, then move on to our <a href="/python/plotly-fundamentals/">Plotly Fundamentals tutorials</a> or dive straight in to some <a href="/python/basic-charts/">Basic Charts tutorials</a>.</p>

<h4 id="Add-a-Background-Image">Add a Background Image<a class="anchor-link" href="#Add-a-Background-Image">&#182;</a></h4><p>In this page we explain how to add static, non-interactive images as background, logo or annotation images to a figure. For exploring image data in interactive charts, see the <a href="/python/imshow">tutorial on displaying image data</a>.</p>
<p>A background image can be added to the layout of a figure with
<code>fig.add_layout_image</code> or by setting the <code>images</code> parameter of <code>go.Layout</code>. The
<code>source</code> attribute of a <code>go.layout.Image</code> can be the URL of an image, or a PIL
Image object (<code>from PIL import Image; img = Image.open('filename.png')</code>).</p>

<h3 id="Annotating-layout-image-with-shapes">Annotating layout image with shapes<a class="anchor-link" href="#Annotating-layout-image-with-shapes">&#182;</a></h3><p><em>introduced in plotly 4.7</em></p>
<p>It can be useful to add shapes to a layout image, for highlighting an object, drawing bounding boxes as part of a machine learning training set, or identifying seeds for a segmentation algorithm.</p>
<p>In order to enable shape drawing, you need to</p>
<ul>
<li>define a dragmode corresponding to a drawing tool (<code>'drawline'</code>,<code>'drawopenpath'</code>, <code>'drawclosedpath'</code>, <code>'drawcircle'</code>, or <code>'drawrect'</code>)</li>
<li>add <a href="/python/configuration-options#add-optional-shapedrawing-buttons-to-modebar">modebar buttons</a> corresponding to the drawing tools you wish to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>The style of new shapes is specified by the <code>newshape</code> layout attribute. Shapes can be selected and modified after they have been drawn. More details and examples are given in the <a href="/python/shapes#drawing-shapes-on-cartesian-plots">tutorial on shapes</a>.</p>
<p>Drawing or modifying a shape triggers a <code>relayout</code> event, which <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/interactive-graphing">can be captured by a callback inside a Dash application</a>.</p>
