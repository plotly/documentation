<p>To scale the bubble size, use the attribute sizeref. We recommend using the following formula to calculate a sizeref value:</p>
<p><code>sizeref = 2. * max(array of size values) / (desired maximum marker size ** 2)</code></p>
<p>Note that setting <code>sizeref</code> to a value greater than $1$, decreases the rendered marker sizes, while setting <code>sizeref</code> to less than $1$, increases the rendered marker sizes.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://plotly.com/python/reference/scatter/#scatter-marker-sizeref">https://plotly.com/python/reference/scatter/#scatter-marker-sizeref</a> for more information. Additionally, we recommend setting the sizemode attribute: <a href="https://plotly.com/python/reference/scatter/#scatter-marker-sizemode">https://plotly.com/python/reference/scatter/#scatter-marker-sizemode</a> to area.</p>
