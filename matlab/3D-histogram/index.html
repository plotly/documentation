<h2>Specify Bin Edges of Histogram</h2>

<p>Generate 1,000 pairs of random numbers and create a bivariate histogram. Specify the bin edges using two vectors, with infinitely wide bins on the boundary of the histogram to capture all outliers that do not satisfy |x|&lt;2.</p>

<pre class="mcode">
x = randn(1000,1);
y = randn(1000,1);
Xedges = [-Inf -2:0.4:2 Inf];
Yedges = [-Inf -2:0.4:2 Inf];
h = histogram2(x,y,Xedges,Yedges)

</pre>

<p>When the bin edges are infinite, <code>histogram2</code> displays each outlier bin (along the boundary of the histogram) as being double the width of the bin next to it.</p>

<p>Specify the <code>Normalization</code> property as <code>&#39;countdensity&#39;</code> to remove the bins containing the outliers. Now the volume of each bin represents the frequency of observations in that interval.</p>

<h2>Saving and Loading Histogram2 Objects</h2>

<p>Use the <code>savefig</code> function to save a <code>histogram2</code> figure.</p>
