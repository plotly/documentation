<h2>Specify Axes for Stairstep Plots</h2>

<p>Starting in R2019b, you can display a tiling of plots using the <code>tiledlayout</code> and <code>nexttile</code> functions. Call the <code>tiledlayout</code> function to create a 2-by-1 tiled chart layout. Call the <code>nexttile</code> function to create the axes objects <code>ax1</code> and <code>ax2</code>. Create separate stairstep plots in the axes by specifying the axes object as the first argument to <code>stairs</code>.</p>

<pre class="mcode">
x = linspace(0,2*pi);
y1 = 5*sin(x);
y2 = sin(5*x);
tiledlayout(2,1)

% Top plot
ax1 = nexttile;
stairs(ax1,x,y1)

% Bottom plot
ax2 = nexttile;  
stairs(ax2,x,y2)

fig2plotly()
</pre>

<p>plot<em>7</em>0<em>specify</em>axes<em>for</em>stairstep_plots</p>

<!--------------------- EXAMPLE BREAK ------------------------->

<h2>Modify Stairstep Plot After Creation</h2>

<p>Create a stairstep plot of two data series and return the two stair objects.</p>

<pre class="mcode">
X = linspace(0,1,30)';
Y = [cos(10*X), exp(X).*sin(10*X)];
h = stairs(X,Y);

fig2plotly()
</pre>

<p>plot<em>8</em>0<em>modify</em>stairstep<em>plot</em>after_creation</p>

<p>Use small circle markers for the first data series. Use magenta filled circles for the second series. Use dot notation to set properties.</p>

<pre class="mcode">
h(1).Marker = 'o';
h(1).MarkerSize = 4;
h(2).Marker = 'o';
h(2).MarkerFaceColor = 'm';

fig2plotly()
</pre>

<p>plot<em>8</em>1<em>modify</em>stairstep<em>plot</em>after_creation</p>

<!--------------------- EXAMPLE BREAK ------------------------->

<h2>Create a Stairstep Plot using plot Function</h2>

<p>Evaluate two cosine functions at 50 equally spaced values between 0 and 4π and create a stairstep plot using <code>plot</code>. </p>

<pre class="mcode">
X = linspace(0,4*pi,50)';
Y = [0.5*cos(X), 2*cos(X)];
[xb,yb] = stairs(X,Y);

fig2plotly()
</pre>

<p><code>stairs</code> returns two matrices of the same size, <code>xb</code> and <code>yb</code>, but no plot. </p>

<p>Use <code>plot</code> to create the stairstep plot with <code>xb</code> and <code>yb</code>. </p>

<pre class="mcode">
figure
plot(xb,yb)

fig2plotly()
</pre>

<p>plot<em>9</em>1<em>create</em>a<em>stairstep</em>plot<em>using</em>plot_function</p>
