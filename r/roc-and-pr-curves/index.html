				<h2>ROC and PR Curves in R</h2>

<p>Interpret the results of your classification using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) Curves in R with Plotly.</p>

<h2>Preliminary plots</h2>

<p>Before diving into the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, we will look at two plots that will give some context to the thresholds mechanism behind the ROC and PR curves.</p>

<p>In the histogram, we observe that the score spread such that most of the positive labels are binned near 1, and a lot of the negative labels are close to 0. When we set a threshold on the score, all of the bins to its left will be classified as 0&#39;s, and everything to the right will be 1&#39;s. There are obviously a few outliers, such as <strong>negative</strong> samples that our model gave a high score, and <em>positive</em> samples with a low score. If we set a threshold right in the middle, those outliers will respectively become <strong>false positives</strong> and <em>false negatives</em>.</p>

<p>As we adjust thresholds, the number of false positives will increase or decrease, and at the same time the number of true positives will also change; this is shown in the second plot. As you can see, the model seems to perform fairly well, because the true positive rate and the false positive rate decreases sharply as we increase the threshold. Those two lines each represent a dimension of the ROC curve.</p>

<h2>Basic binary ROC curve</h2>

<p>We  display the area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC). While ROC shows how the TPR and FPR vary with the threshold, the ROC AUC is a measure of the classification model&#39;s ability to distinguish one class from the other. An ideal classifier will have ROC AUC = 1. In our example, we see that the ROC AUC is fairly high, thus consistent with our interpretation of the previous plots.</p>

<h2>Multiclass ROC Curve</h2>

<p>When you have more than 2 classes, you will need to plot the ROC curve for each class separately. Make sure that you use a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multiclassPairs/vignettes/Tutorial.html">one-versus-rest</a> model, or make sure that your problem has a multi-label format; otherwise, your ROC curve might not return the expected results.</p>
