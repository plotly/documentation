          <h4>Splom trace</h4>

<p>A scaterplot matrix is a matrix associated to n numerical arrays (data variables), $X^1,X^2,.,X_n$ , of the same length. The cell (i,j) of such a matrix displays the scatter plot of the variable Xi versus Xj ,</p>

<p>The Plotly splom trace implementation for the scaterplot matrix does not require to set $x=Xi$ , and $y=Xj$, for each scatter plot. All arrays, $X^1,X^2,.,X_n$ , are passed once, through a list of dicts called dimensions, i.e. each array/variable represents a dimension.</p>

<p>A trace of type splom is defined as follows:</p>

<p>The label in each dimension is assigned to the axes titles of the corresponding matrix cell.</p>

<p>text is either a unique string assigned to all points displayed by splom or a list of strings of the same length as the dimensions, $X_i$. The <code>text[k]</code> is the tooltip for the $k^{th}$ point in each cell.</p>

<p>marker sets the markers attributes in all scatter plots.</p>

<h4>Splom for the diabetes dataset</h4>

<p>Diabetes dataset is downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data">kaggle</a>. It is used to predict the onset of diabetes based on 8 diagnostic measures. The diabetes file contains the diagnostic measures for 768 patients, that are labeled as non-diabetic (Outcome=0), respectively diabetic (Outcome=1). The splom associated to the 8 variables can illustrate the strength of the relationship between pairs of measures for diabetic/nondiabetic patients.</p>

<h3>What About Dash?</h3>

<p><a href="https://dashr.plot.ly/">Dash for R</a> is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. </p>

<p>Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.</p>

<p>Everywhere in this page that you see <code>fig</code>, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the <code>figure</code> argument of the <a href="https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph"><code>Graph</code> component</a> from the built-in <code>dashCoreComponents</code> package like this:</p>
