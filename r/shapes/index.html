<h3>What About Dash?</h3>

<p><a href="https://dashr.plot.ly/">Dash for R</a> is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. </p>

<p>Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.</p>

<p>Everywhere in this page that you see <code>fig</code>, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the <code>figure</code> argument of the <a href="https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph"><code>Graph</code> component</a> from the built-in <code>dashCoreComponents</code> package like this:</p>
